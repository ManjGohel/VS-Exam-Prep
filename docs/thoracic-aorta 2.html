<p><strong>What is an aortic dissection?</strong></p>
<p>It’s when a tear occurs in the intima that results in separation of
layers of the intima and media and allows blood to flow through the
false lumen.</p>
<p><strong>How common are they and how serious are they?</strong></p>
<p>Acute dissections occur around 3/100000 - 2-3x more common than ruptured
aortic aneurysm. For Type A dissections, early mortality 1-2% per hour -
if untreated, 20% die within 6 hours, 50% within 24 hours, 70% first
week. </p>
<p>Main cause of death in type A is aortic rupture into the pericardium,
acute aortic regurgitation, and coronary ostia compromise. While
patients with descending thoracic aortic dissections are more likely to
die from end organ compromise due to obstruction of visceral or
extremity vessels in the acute phase of the disease. </p>
<p><strong>The time frame is also important.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hyperacute &lt;24 hours </p></li>
<li><p>Acute  &lt; 2 weeks  </p></li>
<li><p>Subacute 2 weeks – 3 months -&gt; TEVAR</p></li>
<li><p>Chronic &gt;3 months  -&gt; Chronic aneurysmal degeneration/ partial
false lumen thrombosis (highest risk) = operative treatment</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When we think about aortic dissections there are a few
classifications, how can we break it down?</strong></p>
<p>Historically, there are the Stanford and Debakey Criteria.</p>
<p>Anatomical Stanford</p>
<ul>
<li><p> Type  A - involves the ascending aorta, 2/3 (most common)</p></li>
<li><p> Type  B - arises from distal to L subclavian, 1/3</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Debakey</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A</p>
<ul>
<li><p>1 - ascending + descending</p></li>
<li><p>2 - ascending only</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>B - distal or at the LSCA.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>3a - Descending aorta above diaphragm</p></li>
<li><p>3b - Descending aorta above and below diaphragm</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How about the new system proposed by Dr Lombardi, the SVS-STS
classification system?</strong></p>
<p>The new system published in 2020 keeps A and B and adds a number system
which divides the aorta into zones from 0 proximaly to 12 distally in
the mid SFA.<span class="citation"><sup>[<a href="#ref-lombardiSocietyVascularSurgery2020" role="doc-biblioref">415</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p><img src="images/thoracic_dissection1.png" width="470" /></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Type A is now JUST the ascending aorta to the innominate, also
called Zone 0. </p></li>
<li><p>Type B is now an entry tear in Zone 1 or greater and distally to
whichever zone the dissection lands in.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This anatomical</strong> <strong>classification is based on reading the CT angio.
What else could we see on a CT angio that we have to know about?</strong></p>
<p>So aside from the aortic dissection its self, you could see a bleb of
contrast sticking out. That could be an penetrating aortic ulcer. That
is an atherosclerotic lesion that penetrates the internal elastic lamina
of the aortic wall.</p>
<p>Another key finding can be an intramural hematoma which is a hyperdense
crescent shaped hemorrhage within the aortic wall. There is no
identifiable direct communication between the true and false lumen. IMH
are classified in the same way but with the abbreviation IMH p-d zones.</p>
<p><img src="images/thoracic_dissection2.png" width="470" /></p>
<p><strong>Whats the significance of these two in combination?</strong></p>
<p>There is a higher chance of aortic rupture if a penetrating aortic ulcer
is seen with intramural hematoma.</p>
<p><strong>When a patient presents with an aortic dissection how can we classify
them clinically?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Uncomplicated </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Stable hemodynamics </p></li>
<li><p>No evidence of malperfusion</p></li>
<li><p>Pain controlled </p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Complicated </p>
<ul>
<li><p>End organ ischemia / malperfusjon</p></li>
<li><p>Rupture or impending rupture</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>High risk </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Uncontrollable pain / hypertension </p></li>
<li><p>Bloody pleural effusion</p></li>
<li><p>Aortic diameter &gt;40mm / False lumen diameter &gt; 22mm</p></li>
<li><p>Readmission</p></li>
<li><p>Radiographic only malperfusion </p></li>
<li><p>Entry tear on the lesser curve</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the danger of a false lumen? How does it lead to symptoms and
malperfusion? Likewise which arteries commonly branch off the true
lumen?</strong></p>
<p>The false lumen can lead to end organ ischemia as the intimal flap can
cover the ostia of branching vessels. This can be a static or a dynamic
obstruction.</p>
<p>Likewise it also leads to weakening in the wall of the aorta which can
become a threatened rupture or rupture if the diameter of the false
lumen is larger than 22mm. </p>
<p>The celiac trunk, SMA, right renal typicaly come of the true lumen. Left
renal comes off the false. </p>
<p>Also the dissection most commonly goes down into the left common illiac
rather than the right. You might be able to detect down stream effects
of this on clinical exam with reduced left sided groin pulse.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of patients get aortic dissections?</strong></p>
<p>Hypertension (older patients) / cocaine or Meth (younger patients) </p>
<p>Marfans, loeys-Dietz, Ehlers danlos Type 4, Turners, Arteritis, Bicuspid
aortic valve.</p>
<p>We also have a traumatic cause of aortic dissections. That being called
blunt thoracic aortic injury:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Grade 1: intima tear</p></li>
<li><p>Grade 2: IMH</p></li>
<li><p>Grade 3: Pseudo aneurysm</p></li>
<li><p>Grade 4: Aortic rupture.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How do these patients present?</strong></p>
<p>Signs and symptoms – Chest pain 90% tearing pain radiating between the
shoulder blades. </p>
<p>Chest pain extending to the abdomen abdomen? Think mesenteric ischemia
or aortic tear</p>
<p>Type A - Stroke 5-10%, Syncope 15%, tamponade, carotid dissection,
paralysis. </p>
<p>Others: MI – Hypovolemic shock – leg ischemia</p>
<p><strong>What is the workup?</strong></p>
<p>Physical Exam – Asymmetric pulses / blood pressure differences /
Diastolic murmur,</p>
<p>Investigations - CXR, EKG, D-dimer + Troponin, CTA, ECHO for type A. </p>
<p>The big distinction is to find out if this is a type A or type B because
the treatment strategy is completely different.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Type A need an emergent operation</p></li>
<li><p>Type B starts with medical management, follow up CT angio  +/- Trans
esophageal echo in the OR. Reevaluate at 24 hours. </p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are the details of Type A treatment?</strong></p>
<p>Operative treatment. 30% op mortality. Cardiothoracics take the lead on
this one. However vascular surgeons should be involved in the management
of type A as after the repair, a type A can become a functional type B.</p>
<p>Type B is in the realm of vascular surgery. What is the first management
step after we have diagnosed a type B dissection?</p>
<p>Invasive impulse therapy. That means redusing the force of transmitted
impulse down the aorta. Blood pressure goals of 100-120mmHg. Hr &lt;
60bpm. </p>
<p><strong>How would you achieve that?</strong> </p>
<p>Start with a beta-blocker (esmolol or labetalol) first then a
vasodilator (nitroprusside). This is to stop the sympathetic surge after
vasodialation that could increase pressure and thus tearing forces
inside the aorta worsening the dissection. </p>
<p>Initial CT, 72 hours, 3 months x 4, q6 months x2, q12 month. (Descending
thoracic aorta that dialates first.) </p>
<p><strong>Why isnt open surgery indicated for type B dissections?</strong></p>
<p>Open surgery is not recommended due to the high mortality 30% if &lt; 48
hours. 18% if &gt; 49 hours. </p>
<p>In the acute setting mortality can be up to 50% with a 20% paraplegia
risk. Its been described as sowing tissue paper.</p>
<p><strong>What is the management plan for a complicated Type B aortic
dissection?</strong></p>
<p>Start with invasive medical management and plan for TEVAR. The goal with
TEVAR being to direct the blood flow into the true lumen and seal the
entry tear.  If there was a dynamic obstruction (flap occludes branching
vessels.) Then TEVAR would reestablish the true lumen hence removing the
dynamic obstruction. Endovascular fenestration can also equalise the
pressure in the true and false lumen.<span class="citation"><sup>[<a href="#ref-lombardiSTABLEIIClinical2020" role="doc-biblioref">416</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>For a static occlusion there could be a thrombus or stenosis in the
branched vessel so a stent might be indicated. </p>
<p><strong>What are the major risks of TEVAR in the management of Type B aortic
dissections?</strong></p>
<p>Retrograde type A (reported 2% in literature however it can be around
20% in some experiences), 5% paraplegia, and stent induced new entry.</p>
<p><strong>Is there a role for TEVAR in uncomplicated type B dissections?</strong></p>
<p>The INSTEAD and INSTEAD XL trials looked at uncomplicated Type B
dissections. There was NO statistical difference at 2 years comparing
OMT vs TEVAR but at 5 years there was good aortic remodelling and better
long term survival in patients treated in the subacute stage. </p>
<p>Timing for TEVAR is a difficult choice. In chronic dissections the
septum thickens leading to a potentially difficult TEVAR.  Anecdotally
TEVAR is best at 2w-3m.</p>

<p><strong>Can you take us through the Crawford classification to start off?</strong></p>
<p><strong>T</strong>he Crawford classification is relatively recent, to be honest it
was 1986. And I think it was really important because it’s very
practical classification, depending on body cavity and how to get to an
aneurysm. It’s a bit old in terms of anatomy because they don’t really
follow a pattern one would expect going one to four would be getting
either more extensive or less extensive. And it’s not quite like that.</p>
<p>So type one is from the left subclavian down to just below the
diaphragm. And that’s crucial because that distinguishes it from a
thoracic aneurysm, which you can get to just from the chest and from a
practical surgical approach. That’s a very important differentiating
marker, but you have to go into a second cavity.</p>
<p>Type two is the biggie. So this is from the left subclavian all the way
down to your bifurcation. So both abdominal and thoracic exposure, all
the visceral, renal arteries and a lot of intercostal and lumbers. So
big impact for cord supply, et cetera.</p>
<p>So three is for mid chest down to and involving the viscera renals and
bifurcation. And that’s the one, which really is I suppose, the
differentiator between whether you go for the full support that’s needed
in a type two, or whether you can risk a clamp and go approach.</p>
<p>And type four is characterized by being in most patients accessible from
the abdomen. I say in most patients, because there are some anatomical
situations with body habitus, which means that going into the left chest
is useful even for type four aneurysm.</p>
<p>Then type five. It was an additional classification that came in later,
which is a bit like a type three at the top of the type one at the
bottom effectively, but not everyone uses that.</p>
<p><strong>There appears to have been an increase in the incidence of
thoracoabdominal aneurysms. Do you think it’s a true increase or does
this relate to having scans for other reasons picked up by accident and
then going on from that? What sort of many referrals do you get in a
year and what’s your turn down?</strong> <strong>How many numbers are you actually
doing in your practice year on year?</strong></p>
<p>So that’s interesting because the overall incidence of infrarenal
atherosclerotic aneurysms is going down every year in the national UK
vascular registry. And I suppose that is a legacy of the end of smoking
for a big group of patients. I think thoracoabdominal aneurysms are
going up partly because we are now imaging more and more people. and
therefore we are imaging the chest and seeing them, which perhaps wasn’t
the case, previously. So that’s an artificial increase in incidence, but
also the rate of aortic dissection is on the rise, s chronic post
dissection aneurysms are increasing. I think it’s a small group, but
there is more knowledge about connective tissue disease and genetic
studies and family screening, which perhaps is also a small part of
annual increase. So over the next, 10, 20 years, certainly aneurysms are
not going to go away. And that group of patients that have been affected
are still around and there is a huge number now within the national UK
screening program under surveillance for small animism, so it will come
to fruition.</p>
<p><strong>You’ve just touched on a bit of difference in the etiology between
thoracoabdominal aneurysms and abdominal aortic aneurysm. So is there a
huge difference in the etiology between these two type of aneurysm from
your experience?</strong></p>
<p>On presentation, the majority of aneurysms are asymptomatic. So they’re
found incidentally. It is. rare that you get a symptomatic aneurysm?
Yes. Some can get tender as they perhaps approach a time when the wall
perhaps is going to breach pre rupture.~~ Um,~~ I think
thoracoabdominal aneurysms perhaps tend to be a bit more symptomatic and
infrarenal. And these are ones that perhaps affect go into the arch and
past present with hoarseness tension. Some of them can cause long kill
compression.~~ Um,~~ and there is a group that caused dark station
of the cross.</p>
<p>And it’s,~~ you know,~~ you know, I’ve seen,~~ uh,~~ over the
years, the actual cross of a die from acts like an extrinsic lap and~~
it,~~ it, can be extremely tight at that point. And there was a group
of patients that present with excruciating [00:09:00] pain, radiating
around their cost of margin. And this is tension on the cross and it’s
often not thought of as a sign of a, of an aneurysm, but I think in that
group, it is, and the larger, the extent of aneurysm, I think. Things
like weight loss general,~~ uh,~~ poor health begins to become
increasingly seen in that group with chronic</p>
<p>aneurysms. So there are some subtle differences. The</p>
<p>The, other group that tends to occur, not in informing lack of isms is
the post dissection aneurysms, and the majority of those all known
about. But there was a time when type a dissections,~~ um,~~ as in
sort of DeBakey type one or a Stanford type one, which went all the way
down.</p>
<p>We’re only monitored really with echo and the east ending. And the rest
was forgotten about, they got lost between two stools, between Claudia.
Fantastic. Follow-up that group,~~ um,~~ is a different group Cause
w we [00:10:00] already know they’ve got an aneurysm, so there are
subtle differences. And then the connective tissue group, I suppose, is
a bit different.</p>
<p>because they tend to have more extensive aneurysms rather than just
confined to the infrarenal sacrament, which is by far, in the way, the
most common for abdominal aneurysms.</p>
<p><strong>Greaves:</strong> So you’ve mentioned quite a few different ideologies there.
And moving on to specifically thoracic aneurysms, know that as you said,
a quarter of these are associated with dissection in the past, as small
players will have underlying connective tissue disease, do you think
these patients will have a different threshold for intervention compared
to the non-connected tissue disorder?</p>
<p><strong>Jenkins:</strong> Yeah, I think it’s well established that,~~ um,~~ the
risk of rupture in any connective tissue disease. And I think we’ve
gotta be aware that the ones we talk about more family</p>
<p>states,~~ uh,~~ vascular stem loss. These are ones that are probably
the tip of the iceberg of a number [00:11:00] of other. Cases that we
don’t know the genetic sequencing for, but behave differently. But data
from a I mentioned point of view is not quite as robust as one would
hope, but~~ the~~ threshold that most people would agree~~
for,~~ for, non connective tissue disorders~~ <del>would be about six
centimeters. And that takes into account</del> the,~~ the increased risks
of operating both in the chest and the Thor abdominal segment. I think
most people would agree that five centimeters is a better cutoff for
connective tissue patients. Some cardiac surgeons would do a young more
funny sending at four and a half centimeters. It does vary a little bit
geographically, a bit like the threshold for infer in Lanny wisdoms,
which varies from you have the states in UK. So you’ve got to look at
the patient in front of you and make a decision. and. I would certainly
upper [00:12:00] threshold for someone who was not so fit and perhaps
lower it a bit for a younger patient, and also be aware of it’s
something all down atomically, a saccular bulge, something where you
think there could be a, my Kotick element.</p>
<p>Those are all very different to knee. You can’t be reassured by a
dimension in an axial plane~~ that~~ that is safe. Savannah ups the
ante, in terms of,~~ um,~~ whether you would pair at an earlier
threshold and I’d include, they have a blowout for an eccentric Pau or
anything like that. It is not a conventional fusiform any wisdom.</p>
<p><strong>Barkat:</strong> So Mr.</p>
<p>Dinkins, can you talk us through the issue zones of that water and why
do we need to know about these?</p>
<p><strong>Jenkins:</strong> so is Mo was one of those useful classifications, you know,
there’s lots of classifications in medicine,~~ um,~~ but it’s nice
to find one that’s actually got a use. And what this did is make sure
that everyone was on the same [00:13:00] page when you are
reporting,~~ um,~~ zones or seals zones for thoracic devices. So
that is important for two reasons.</p>
<p>One the extent of coverage and two, the complications increased, the
more proximally you go. And the main complication for that is stroke. So
issue Marla decided. to. Classifies zones. So zone zero, which is the
first most proximal zone is the sending a water up to and including the
brachiocephalic trunk, then between the brachiocephalic trunk and the
left common carotid artery is zone one between the left common carotid
artery and the left subclavian artery to zoom, to distill to the
subclavian artery then is zone three.</p>
<p>And in some people add in a sort of zone for distal to T4 level, which
is much lower down the thoracic air, water, and most thoracic stenting
will go really to zoom two or perhaps in,~~ into, uh,~~ into zone
three or [00:14:00] perhaps into zone two, The more proximal you go,
obviously yeah. more work needs to be done in terms of either extra
anatomical, deep bond Xing or using some form of fenestrated or launched
arch device with an increase in stroke</p>
<p>risk. But what this allowed people to do is compare different series. So
you’re not just saying,~~ well,~~ these were a group of TIVA
patients. You could define exactly how</p>
<p>proximally they, they go. And the same, I I suppose, applies for the
corporate classification. It allows us,~~ um,~~ comparison within
thoracoabdominal groups.</p>
<p>And that’s important with both survival and complication rates, because
if your series is mainly~~ a~~ type two or extend to dominoes,
you’re going to have a very different outcomes from someone who’s got
mainly type four. So of dominoes,~~ um,~~ and both glass patients
allow you to look at and [00:15:00] data between units.</p>
<p><strong>Greaves:</strong> So if a patient has a thoracic aneurysm that affects their
ascending aorta, we obviously involve the cardiac surgeons. The patient
may require an elephant trunk procedure prior to intervention on the
descending aorta. Can you briefly summarize the difference between a
conventional elephant trunk and a frozen elephant trunk, and when to use
one over.</p>
<p><strong>Jenkins:</strong> so,~~ so, um, <del>the vast majority of this I suppose, is
particularly pertinent to the section. So</del> <del>we have to accept a little
of, is also more elective aneurysmal disease, but the main purpose</del>
in,~~ in a type a or LT section is actually to protect the heart. So
people die of either for pericardium or stripping the colony osteo off
and getting ischemia.~~ Um,~~ the. purpose. All the time a repair is
to protect the heart. And to some extent for,~~ uh, uh,~~ uh, type
one, erotic, the is to then [00:16:00] ensure a true lumen flow
distally.~~ Um,~~ and so it was very popular because it was probably
the least invasive to do a short into position, a sending repair, but
that’s really problems for later.</p>
<p>And as people became more adapt and better conjure protection and bring
protection~~ um,~~ it became more popular to do a more extensive
repair. The first sitting and this involves an</p>
<p>arch repair.~~ Um,~~ and then an acceptance that eventually the
descending thoracic aorta will still need to be repaired, but at a later
stage, Now you have to be aware that the ACE sending an arch is done
from a median sternotomy, and it’s really difficult to get beyond the
left sub clave and form that,~~ um,~~ position.</p>
<p>So when the arch was done, it was felt that the elephant trunk came from
leaving,~~ uh,~~ an extra piece of [00:17:00] one within the
descending thoracic aorta in the two lumen of it during a section or in
the main lumen of a, of an aneurysm by a double sewing technique on the
distal and Estimote says and an inverting it, and it, would be left
free,~~ um,~~ perfused in the descending, thoracic aorta.</p>
<p>And the benefit of that was when one came back to then do the descending
thoracic segment,~~ um,~~ via left thoracotomy, You could very
quickly open the altar and clamp</p>
<p>that,~~ um,~~ deck on. And then you’ve got a ready, made an estimate
SIS to D to do your segment, which was much easier. And it meant you
didn’t have to grow up and dissect to the left, to play in whether it be
scar tissue~~ in a,~~ in a, previous, in estimate basis. Now,
what~~ um,~~ realized is that they could help with this procedure by
actually facilitating a device which had four blond shares or three or
[00:18:00] four,~~ um,~~ bond shares on a piece of Dacron, which was
sized to be a, an arch replacement. And these were ready. So norm survey
took 10 millimeter bunches to allow an extra pipe for rewarming. And
these could then be sewn to be a nominate, carotid and subclavian and
attached to, and piece of Dacron was then a stint graft, which could
then be placed distally in, lieu of what was previously a floppy piece
of that cone.</p>
<p>And two manufacturers really geo-tech and two-way Alltech,~~ uh,~~
have made these devices, which just facilitate and make things much easy
and so-called FET or frozen elephant trunk,~~ um,~~ has now become
quite popular. I don’t quite know why it’s called frozen, but I think it
perhaps means that the thoracic eight segment is,~~ uh,~~ is, stiff
as in a supported evolve rather than just a floppy deck on</p>
<p>segment.</p>
<p><strong>Barkat:</strong> [00:19:00] So if we look at it at the isolated,~~ uh,~~
thoracic aneurysm, Mr. Jenkins, can you tell us briefly about the
principle of T VAR and what’s the optimal landing zone and in your
opinion is rapid ventricular pacing required when deploying these
stents.</p>
<p><strong>Jenkins:</strong> So I think the isolated, thoracic aneurysm is a perfect
treatment,~~ um,~~ for TIVA because~~ <del>it actually, it, it
fulfills all those minimally invasive credentials in that you can do, an
endoluminal approach. And if you can get a good seal zone, proximally
and distally,</del> it~~ saves us a lot to me. And it’s a massive
difference for the patients,~~ you know,~~ unfortunately I suppose
those cartoons you see on the industry and for it’s so vanishingly rare
when you’ve got a perfect proximal and distal landing zone and have
really straight . um, I think for the majority of cases you still needed
to send to me to seal zone proximally and distally. And I think if
you’ve got a very [00:20:00] torturous aorta, you’ve got to think about
a longer, seal zone you want to land,~~ um,~~ in an area where there
is a good power level walled segment. And you’ve got to be careful of
so-called bird beaking when they, when a stiff, less conformable
device,~~ um,~~ lands perfectly on the outer curve, but holds off on
the inner curve.</p>
<p>So as you’ve got a lip, which protrudes and that’s going, to allow blood
to get under that and cause sense, graph crushing, I think modern
devices have been now much more conformable. We’ve learned the lessons
of oversizing and the problems associated with oversizing. We’ve learned
how to tape a stent grafts when there’s mismatch between proximal and
distal. and we’ve also got customed taper devices now. So these have all
significantly improved things, but there’s still no getting away from
the fact that some anatomy is [00:21:00] not well adjusted to the
currently available stent, grafts</p>
<p>and Gothic arches, a particular problem.</p>
<p>I’ve already mentioned vape torturous and beta launch sacks, which allow
a stench graph to move away from the wasting line to the out to curve.</p>
<p>And as they affect sectors and shrink, you can imagine that draws on
both the proximal and distal seals zone and reduces them.~~ So,
um,~~ I think you can sometimes get away with a shorter lending zone.
If, for example, you’re doing a post traumatic aneurysm where it’s only
on one segment VNO the outer wall where there’s a problem. Um, but for
the vast majority of two aneurysms, you need that seal zone and you do
need to oversize</p>
<p>to achieve that.~~ Um,~~ you can, of course go more proximately. And
I think the majority of aneurysms app left some in area, you can just
drop them [00:22:00] blood pressure to a systolic of 70 or 80
pharmacologically.</p>
<p>Once you go more proximal to that, especially if you’ve got a custom
device where with a scallop or bond device where you need an absolutely
critical lending zone,</p>
<p>you then really need to achieve a short transient period of circulatory
arrest either with the dentist’s scene, which is perhaps sometimes a bit
unreliable. Or~~ rapid ACEing~~ rapid pacing does come with
complications though. And,~~ you know,~~ you</p>
<p>can get ventricular puncture from rapid pacing,~~ um,~~ and it can
be difficult. There are some newer techniques in terms of Keval,
occlusion, balloons as well, which basically stop venous blood returning
to the heart with a reduction in outputs. those are gaining popularity
certainly in Germany. And they can be quite effective for that.~~
Um,~~ I think,~~ you know,~~ having. Tip capture on devices and
better, more accurate [00:23:00] deployment and better imaging does
allow you~~ to,~~ to, actually be more accurate in deployment, but
there are still problems.</p>
<p>These devices have been inserted to very torturous IDX systems
sometimes, and they retain some energy. And when you deliver them by
removing that sheath, sometimes that energy is still and they can jump
forward as well as back.~~ Um,~~ and that can cause problems because
you end up covering a vessel that you didn’t intend to So you’ve just
explained in detail at T virus is a great option and a lot of cases, but
I presume you still believe there is a place for open repair in
isolated, thoracic aneurysms, and why.</p>
<p>Yeah, I’m not so sure in isolated, thoracic aneurysms, unless for some
reason that they’re not suitable~~ for~~ for TIVA,~~ um,~~ I
think if you’ve got problems with,~~ um,~~ a mycotic aneurysm or a
fistula in for Blanca sore, Fergus, the, these are our big problems with
high mortality [00:24:00] and your duty bound to go.</p>
<p>And certainly with connective tissue</p>
<p>patients,~~ um,~~ again, open has advantages, but you all, and it is
possible sometimes to bridge between repairs. So I, I think in some of
the younger connective tissue patients, they will end up having certain
segments were paired at different stages of their life. And although
it’s probably now accepted that all endovascular is not a good option
for these patients. If you’ve got. Dotcom proximally and deck on
distally already. Well then bridging those segments,~~ whether~~
with a, an endovascular device actually works very well because although
the Dacron will slowly dilate it, won’t out laters as much as, normally
all tick tissue. So there are options, but I think in reality, isolated,
thoracic aneurysms on Weasley where, and probably [00:25:00] VAR can</p>
<p>be used for the majority</p>
<p>of</p>
<p>them.</p>
<p><strong>Barkat:</strong> So Mr. Dink is</p>
<p>moving on to throw up domino aneurysm now. <del>So</del> we earlier used the
Crawford classification to describe the anatomical extent of the
thoracoabdominal aneurysm. So let’s talk firstly, about type 1, 2, 3,
and five, which involved the thoracic of water to a greater or lesser
extent as well as Daptone award.</p>
<p>And we’ll come back to type four later on in this podcast. So type two
open throttle. Aneurysm is arguably the most invasive operation a
patient can undergo and carries 30 day mortality in excess of <del>15 to 20
to</del> 10 to 15%. What is the sash position for type two that you
currently use in your practice?</p>
<p>And is ~~there ~~there’s any strong evidence?</p>
<p><strong>Jenkins:</strong> ~~So, <del>as I suggested earlier,</del> the,~~ the, evidence
is that it’s a bit historical and most people would actually say about
six centimeters. I think that can be brought down a little bit for
connective tissue patients [00:26:00] and can go up a little bit for
atheroma to see patients. But in general, you’re talking about a younger
segment You know, This is not an operation for people in their
eighties.~~ Um,~~ and they’ve got to be pretty physiologically in
really good shape~~ to get~~ to get to this because it is a. A big
onslaught physiologically on them and it’s not just getting them off the
table.~~ It’s,~~ It’s, getting them then out of ITU and out of
hospital and to recover back to their baseline.</p>
<p>And I think that’s one of the things that</p>
<p>can be really difficult. You are taking patients who are effectively
functioning quite well, and they’re often rather to be asymptomatic and
you’re putting them through a proof or lactic operation to~~ try,~~
try and prevent something, which no one quite knows if will happen or
when it’ll happen.</p>
<p><strong>Greaves:</strong> So to that end, can you talk us through the decision making
process when you’re assessing [00:27:00] a patient with a thoraco
abdominal aneurysm 1, 2, 3, or five.</p>
<p><strong>Jenkins:</strong> Yeah. I think,~~ you know,~~ it is really,~~ um,~~
Dependent on anatomy, physiology and the patient in front of you. And it
is this a bespoke assessment for an individual patient. So firstly, I
think you have got to look at what are the options for that patient. And
then it goes from conservative to endovascular, to open surgery.</p>
<p>And,~~ you know,~~ the endovascular domain has changed hugely now
with the availability of bondage devices. when I started there weren’t
custom devices like that. Yes, fever was just coming out, but, and we
did use long covered stents going through devices with TIVA above.
But,~~ um,~~ there wasn’t the</p>
<p>option~~ for,~~ for what we’ve now got from an endovascular
perspective. So I think you’ve got to choose the patients that. have
either. Unsuitable for endovascular, or [00:28:00] are we really going
to benefit from a doability of an open approach?</p>
<p>So those are the</p>
<p>two big differences,~~ I suppose.~~ And they all are because one
you’re going for gold standard approach because you think they’re life
expectancy warrants that the one is a bit hops in this because they
haven’t got another endovascular option. And these range from people
with very tortuous anatomy to difficult renals with four perhaps
difficult renos, renal arteries, or early divisions or ones that aren’t
suitable as target vessels,~~ um,~~ Y to, to sometimes complex
dissections, which. On suitable for an endovascular approach. So it is
very variable, but I suppose the first thing when you’re considering it
is, is, the patient going to get through this and get out of hospital.
And that really is,~~ uh,~~ looking at them in the eye. What’s their
quality of ~~ Like~~ what’s their family support,~~ like,~~ are</p>
<p>they</p>
<p>up for [00:29:00] this?~~ Um,~~ and the second one then is
anatomical difficulties. Is there a Shanghai auto? Is there a lot of our
bathroom, which is diseases? A lot of calcification of a target vessel
is difficult. Um, that sort of thing. And it comes down to them. It’s
rare that there’s a hundred percent or 0% decision. It’s building up
relative contraindications. And some of them are pretty simple, like
access problems for endovascular. And~~ it’s,~~ it’s, a combination
of those which then will sway you in one way or the other. And if
anything, that decision-making is probably more pertinent for type three
and type four, where there really is a different option. And these
patients are perhaps in their sixties and seventies with classic Latham,
which is disease. The really young fit non connective tissue patient
with a type two is aware beast.</p>
<p><strong>Barkat:</strong> So Mr. Has [00:30:00] some textbook specifically for
connective tissue disease. We’ll always prefer an open approach for them
rather than in the vascular approach.</p>
<p>Do you still agree with this.</p>
<p><strong>Jenkins:</strong> Yeah, I do.~~ Um,~~ I think certainly,~~ um,~~ what
were you know about,~~ um,~~ patients who’ve had endovascular,~~ I
mean,~~ total endovascular approaches connective tissue diseases. They
don’t last.~~ so, uh,~~ they may last five years or and then get
progressive,~~ uh,~~ aortic dilatation and,~~ um,~~ loss of
those seals zones,~~ uh,~~ whether that is the natural history of
the native disease or whether it is regional force hooks, bobs, whatever
the device is unclear.</p>
<p>But when you, so these pensions and just touching the back end of a
needle on the anterior wall will create a massive problem or just being
a little bit clumsy and you get a regional town. It’s very clear that a
stiff device sitting in those for many years were with 60 beats, 70
beats per minute, [00:31:00] going through it and often</p>
<p>hypertension isn’t going last.</p>
<p>So I think we now know that, but there are some caveats, as I mentioned
earlier, bridging between previous prosthetic open repairs is a
possibility and sometimes lifesaving situation. When someone is
presented with a rupture, you may have to use an endovascular
approach,~~ um,~~ and that’s reasonable.~~ Um,~~ but sometimes
be prepared then to treat that as a bridge and go back to do a
definitive repair when have calmed down and in the cold light of day.</p>
<p><strong>Greaves:</strong> So we don’t really have the scope to dive into complex
endovascular repair in this episode, but can you describe sort of the
broad principles of your operative approach to open thoracoabdominal
aneurysm repair, type two, because it’s the most extensive.</p>
<p><strong>Jenkins:</strong> Yeah. <del>So, um,</del> in general, in terms of the patient,~~
um,~~ for anything juxta renal or type four, I tend to have a patient
supine on the [00:32:00] back, but with a break in the table at the
level of the, between the costal margin and the anterior superior iliac
spine, and by breaking the table at that level, you can massively
increase the,~~ um,~~ exposure to that segment.</p>
<p>As I suggested earlier,~~ um,~~ there are some patients even with a
type four approach. that. Demand a thoracoabdominal and this is a left
dog, abdominal, and for a type four, if you’re doing a left sock
abdominal, it’s usually for someone with a very narrow costal margin,
have a cute angle on that. Sometimes a more petite frame female
patient,~~ um,~~ or sometimes a patient that~~ has, um,~~</p>
<p><del>the,</del> the class is very high on the aorta.</p>
<p>And if you look at CT scans is something I’ve realized over many years
that not everyone is the same. So where the celiac Lancaster male can be
in a different proportion, depending on~~ their,~~ where the cost of
marching and the skeleton is, [00:33:00] which can make them easier or
hard~~ to,~~ to. get to. And certainly in a situation, if there is a
rupture within the left side of the abdomen, you wouldn’t really want to
go into that without getting proximal control, because as you do the
visual rotation, you, you could have catastrophic bleeding.</p>
<p>So under those circumstances, I’d also go into the left chest with a
reasonably low segment so that you’ve got it. You can place a clamp
ready before doing the vessel</p>
<p>rotation. So for type four the one above then the higher you go, the
higher or thoracotomy and the more,~~ um,~~ tipped over you need the
patient. So for a type two, you’re going probably fifth space and the
shoulders are at 90 degrees and the pelvis is 60 degrees for type three.
You’re slightly further over. So you’re down to about 60 degrees and
you’re perhaps in the seventh intercostal space. So the more and the
lower you go, then light up to [00:34:00] being pretty much suited. The
left arm is put over</p>
<p>top. You mark</p>
<p>the scapular,~~ um,~~ and <del>you, you go into,</del> you go into the
chest and abdomen. I tend to go into parents and early into the abdomen,
so I can see the bowel of all people who do a retroperitoneal</p>
<p>approach.~~ Um,~~ I tend to divide the diaphragm down to the central
ligament and mark that.~~ Um,~~ and then effectively you are looking
at~~ <del>your clamp soon. So your dissect around your, your Klemp
zone,</del> um,~~ both proximally and distally.~~ Um,~~ we don’t tend
to expose the celiac and SMA in between kill all the white renal. The
left renal It’s important~~ to find,~~ to find the left artery.~~
Um,~~ visceral rotation is effectively you. Extend the left colon up,
find the white line and get under that and get blight on just so our
secures to get right down on so as early on, and then it is a relatively
bloodless field. Everything is taken [00:35:00] me to leave The, you
were to answer the way I always take for left kidney up. You will see in
the textbooks and some of your bland advocate,~~ um,~~ keeping the
left kidney down.~~ Uh,~~ I that’s up to madness to be honest.~~
Um,~~ I can’t see any point in it, so everything rotates up then out
for way. And it it looks a bit strange. It looks a bit like a
post-mortem it looks very odd to see the whole left side of cavity with
all you’ve got is diaphragm muscle, so ass and nothing else left.~~
Um,~~ it does give you a very safe exposure then~~ to,~~ to, Vail.
to. I don’t tend to go round with slings.~~ Um,~~ Avandale, which I
think that can cause problems, uh, tend to go around,~~ um,~~ with
my fingers and be very aware of,~~ uh,~~ the light sided lumbers or
intercostals because you really don’t</p>
<p>want to cause a problem there because you easily get into the white
chest from exposure.</p>
<p>So you have to be a bit careful as soon as you can see exactly~~
where,~~ where, you’re</p>
<p>getting round [00:36:00]</p>
<p><strong>Barkat:</strong> So in specifically in type two,~~ uh, uh, ~~people, a
lot of people establish a left heart bypass. Do you always operate in
that way? And do you use a cardiac surgeon and the setting, or how do
you approach type two in terms to reduce the pressure in the left heart</p>
<p><strong>Jenkins:</strong> <del>So, um,</del> I think type two, now you are mandated to have
some sort of. Adjunct to keep the rest of the body perfused while you’re
doing the proximal anastomosis. I think in an elective setting,~~
um,~~ left heart bypass is the mind’s way forward,~~ um,~~ because
it does give you more flexibility and it allows you then to sequentially
clamp and keep the legs, the vessel or the kidneys perfused. There are
some negative aspects to laptop bypass though, in terms of needing a
much higher ECT and bleeding is the enemy here. So the more you
anti-coagulate, the more problems you’ve got, it’s also not pulsatile
flow.~~ Um,~~ and you’re putting all your, your, cells [00:37:00]
through a pump.~~ Um,~~ and you’ve got to be aware of it, increased
problems around stroke and everything else that goes with that. I think
it’s,~~ um,~~ It is very convenient for that set up because you can
get to in for your problem, move in quite easily.~~ Um,~~ femoral
cannulation is quite easy for you to return.</p>
<p>like,~~ Um,~~ and then you’ve got the option then of individually
calculating,~~ uh,~~ celiac SME,~~ uh,~~ for perfusion. Usually
wrinkles are cooled down.</p>
<p>If you’ve got a perfusionist as well, you can get cold, profuse for the
renals. So it gives you more flexibility. And if things go wrong, you’ve
then got an option to switch to,~~ um,~~ conventional bypass if
needed or eval drain out and go to circulate Triovest and cool-down
things go very wrong. So it does give you. you. More options, however,
in a more emergency setting and approach, should I really like and tends
to work quite well for us is to do what I [00:38:00] call an ax fem
approach. So you would~~ put, uh,~~ use an XM graft onto the light
subclavian lots, obviously tunneled outside of a body onto the white
wall and use the other limb.</p>
<p>Then~~ as,~~ as, a single cannular, usually for estimate, cause SMA
is the king vessel with all of us. Most of the other things can go. If
you lose the SMA, you’ve got a dead patient. And that allows you to do
perhaps an emergency procedure, perhaps a amid type three approach
without some of the problems associated with left heart bypass. It
allows you to have a lower act. It gives you pulse style flow. You’re
not smashing all your cells up all the time. It’s relatively quick and
straightforward to do.~~ Um,~~ you don’t have to move. Ally’s a
perfusionist and everything else that goes with that.~~ Um,~~ and
it’s worked well for us in emergency settings.~~ Um,~~ and it’s
better than a clamp and go approach because with a clamp and go
approach, the type of three you need sort of [00:39:00] in 15 minutes
for you, inlay and estimates of the top, the clock is already on. If you
get down to the visceral segment and</p>
<p>it’s not looking very attractive, and you’ve got to do some removal of
formless and a bit of what I call gardening to get your Corolla patch on
them.</p>
<p>And if you’ve got to reimplant the left kidney separately,~~ it’s,~~
it’s a old time pressure and there’s no for something to wrong
there.~~ Um,~~ and that’s where this gives you a bit more breathing
space that you’ve got the lower body profused while you’re doing your
POCs on an estimate basis.</p>
<p><strong>Greaves:</strong> So, as you’ve mentioned, open repair is clearly a high
tariff, high risk operation apart from death. Are there any specific
complications to the open approach?</p>
<p><strong>Jenkins:</strong> Yeah, I think,~~ um,~~ yeah,~~ the, the,~~ the big
problem is bleeding.~~ So, you know,~~ bleeding is and clamp times,
those are the things that, that,~~ um,~~ cause problems for those
patients who survive. So problems with launch transfusion,~~ um,~~
and cause problems with [00:40:00] then ventilation afterwards.~~
Um,~~ renal ischemia,~~ um,~~ is an issue of people will quote a
40 to 50 minutes,~~ um,~~ enlist schemic time, a warm ischemic time.
You can actually get away for longer than that. The kidney probably
some. Extra blood supply, but it, once beyond that, you are then getting
increasing problems~~ with,~~ with likely failure. Now, yes, they
may need a bit of, to go on the hemofilter for temporary support.~~
Um,~~ but a lot of these patients who already lost a lot of nephrons,
so they, haven’t got a huge amount of capacity to lose more. And that’s
the problem. And that’s why EGF or high creatinine is a really important
prognostic marker of outcome in this patients. I think~~ it’s,
~~it’s</p>
<p>like a bolometer~~ on their,~~ on their, microcirculation. the big
one, of course, the Achilles heel of these approaches, whether it’s end
all work from is called [00:41:00] ischemia.~~ Uh,~~ and that is
because the segment of blood supply to the cord comes from all the
intercostals and lumbers. and if you’ve got that aneurysm extending both
proximally and distally involving the internal ex and the left, some
clave in you’re taking out</p>
<p>your crucial collateral supply, which helps with</p>
<p>cord supply as well. And that is why trying to,~~ ~~ Maintain a
blood supply,~~ um,~~ and getting, for example, getting the lengths
back in circuit early, whether that’s,~~ um,~~ with large sheets,
during a long blanched approach or, and we’re moving machines or getting
the leg supply earlier in an open approach,~~ um,~~ and keeping the
lefts of caving in circuit, these are all other important things and
having paying attention to the mean arterial pressure in theater have a
spinal dreams working.</p>
<p>All of that is crucial in terms of trying to protect the cord</p>
<p>as much as</p>
<p>[00:42:00] possible.</p>
<p><strong>Barkat:</strong> So the major issue is the spinal cord ischemia, and we
mentioned briefly the plot supply of the spinal cord for the sake of the
exam. Can you just ~~recap, ~~recap for us the blood supply of the
spinal cord for the audience who’s going for the.</p>
<p><strong>Jenkins:</strong> So</p>
<p><strong>Barkat:</strong> exam</p>
<p><strong>Jenkins:</strong> it’s complicated actually. Yeah. Yes, sir. and posterior
spinal arteries. But I think depending on what level you are in the
court, they get a blood supplier from a more dominant,~~ um,~~
approach. So higher up in the cord, survival, higher thoracic vertebral
arteries are important to there. so hence the importance of a left to
play in the lower you go there and they can have to become a bit less
important.</p>
<p>And the actual segmental arteries intercostals,~~ uh,~~ become
dominant much as it’s talked about the archery of a dam. Kovich I
think,~~ you know,~~ yes, there may be a dominant vessel at about
that level, but it’s. It’s rarely</p>
<p>one, absolutely single [00:43:00] one. That if you think that you’ve got
that the rest and matter, I think they all matter.</p>
<p>And then the more distally you go launches coming in collateral supply
from internal lilacs meeting say cool, all those contribute to a
collateral circulation that should be seen in some ways, all connected.
And that is why,~~ um,~~ more recently in endovascular,~~ uh,~~
purchase staging repair is really useful because you can not allow the
surviving arteries then to remodel and increase flow.</p>
<p>And it’s why doing a type two repair. When you get the whole lay auto,
it’s very important. to.</p>
<p>Block the intercostals early either by sewing them off or putting big 10
for a little Pruitt ballooning,~~ um,~~ to stop you,~~ uh,~~
losing blood from that collateral,~~ uh,~~ supply. And it keeps the
pressure in, in, in the spinal cord.~~ Um,~~ and that’s why, of
course the [00:44:00] differential position of that blood supply is why
patients then get a particular form of problem with,~~ um,~~
motor,~~ um,~~ problems and sometimes preservation of sensation</p>
<p><strong>Greaves:</strong> So purely for exam purposes and a bit of physiology. Can
you remind us how to calculate the spinal cord profusion?</p>
<p><strong>Jenkins:</strong> all that is really is map minus the CSF pressure. So it’s
your mean arterial pressure Take out the CSF pressure and that’s what
you’ve got perfusing it. And that really is a useful equation to
remember because it actually,~~ uh,~~ allows you to decide what’s
the way to enhance that as much as possible.</p>
<p>And that of course is to increase</p>
<p>map,~~ um,~~ and decrease your CSF pressure. And we do that by
enhancing the mean arterial as much as</p>
<p>possible, and actually draining off CSF with a spinal drain to reduce
your CSF pressure, to allow more blood [00:45:00] into~~ the~~ the
cord. I think people perhaps get a bit hung up on,~~ um,~~ spinal
yeah.</p>
<p>Image and it’s important.</p>
<p>It is just as important to maintain oxygenation and hemoglobin over
hundreds and reduce blood loss. And. all those. Other things are as
crucial.~~ Um,~~ and it’s an adjunct. It’s not, it shouldn’t be seen
in isolation. It’s one of many adjuncts to try and help</p>
<p>with that.</p>
<p><strong>Barkat:</strong> So if you’re looking at the mechanism of the spinal cord
ischemia on the open throw cop dollar award, the Kennedys and repair, do
you think it’s related the blood loss or a clamp or implantation of the
intercostal?</p>
<p><strong>Jenkins:</strong> ~~I think, ~~ I think it’s multifactorial. So I think
the majority is due to,~~ um,~~ ischemia scheme in terms of a
watershed situation, segments of a cord, just not getting enough</p>
<p>blood. And the very reason,~~ you know,~~ [00:46:00] the more
typical area around~~ sort of~~ T 70, 89. to 10. Is, if you think
about it is in the middle between the virtual sub-line Interline like
apply and that’s probably is a kin to,~~ um, you know,~~ a splenic
lecture of the colon or whatever it’s between two territories.~~
Um,~~ but there is also potentially problems with microemboli,~~
um,~~ trashing of a spinal arteries and that can occur in some
patients.~~ Um, it’s,~~ it’s a slightly confusing situation, but I
think in terms of inter operatively, blood loss dumps in blood
pressure,~~ um,~~ with,~~ uh,~~ hypotensive episodes,~~
um,~~ those lots of problems really don’t help. When do you,~~
uh,~~ we implant well that again is a confusing. Some people would
argue if there’s massive blood back bleeding, you obviously don’t need
to be implants cause they’re getting [00:47:00] collapsible supply from
somewhere.~~ Um,~~ I think it will depend on how the case is
going.~~ Um,~~ would you use MVPs?~~ Um,~~ that’s quite a
specialist situation and you’re very reliant on,~~ um,~~ the
readings you get. They can be</p>
<p>confused by legacy and they can be confused by cooling down and a
DEMA.~~ Um,~~ but if you. And already got the legs back in circuits
and got the up and things weren’t improving. and there was a sizable
intercostals that could be reimplanted well, then that’s worth doing.
And that’s why the technique of using Pruitt balloon occlusion methods
in pairs rather than line gating is good because you can then just,~~
um,~~ we implant</p>
<p>those and if you don’t need to implant them, you can just like eat them.
and remove them. Whereas if you’ve already like gated them,~~ you,
you~~ you’ve got a problem because you’ve already destroyed the
ostia[00:48:00] it can be difficult to do that. We tend to leave a
branch already attached in the mid thoracic aorta,~~ um,~~ to save
in an estimate, SIS, you can, if you’ve got really good, intercostals
fill it, that branch to open up. up. And so we don’t like a long patch
longitudinally along the PAD intercostals and then plumb it back on the
other end. It’s It’s a circuit~~ in,~~ in series with your main
aortic graft. And that probably,~~ um,~~ decreases the resistance to
flow. And probably that remains PTEN for a bit longer, rather than
having a big sort of 10 millimeter</p>
<p>graft going into a single pair of with what are likely to have quite a
high resistance.</p>
<p>And they probably don’t last as long</p>
<p><strong>Greaves:</strong> So you think we’re good at predicting preoperatively who
may get spinal cord ischemia and other certain risk factors? You
mentioned a [00:49:00] few already can predict who will or won’t.
Post-operatively.</p>
<p><strong>Jenkins:</strong> I think we’re actually hopeless at it actually.</p>
<p>And,~~ um, I,~~ I really don’t think that there’s a good method.~~
You know,~~ you can see people having an infrarenal a pair getting
paralysis and you can completely utterly,~~ uh,~~ replace the whole
available to for March down to IMAX with prosthetic and have people
walking around without a problem at all.</p>
<p>So I don’t really understand it.~~ Um,~~ and I think that comes into
the business</p>
<p>about,~~ you know,~~ is it embolic?~~ Is it <del>is it flow? Is it
Carol actuals? I think it’s a combination of things.</del> Um,~~</p>
<p><del>you know,</del> when people started embolizing intercostals preoperatively
prior to endo,~~ um,~~ appears people thought,~~ well,~~ this is
a man thing.</p>
<p>You, you want to keep them perfused surely.~~ Um, uh,~~ but I think
it does. Show the importance of maximizing the collateral supply. And I
think some people have a [00:50:00] better collateral supply than
others. And of course, what we do know is when you get down to the more
microscopic level of actual arterial supply at core level, what that is
like in an patient, which you can’t see on imaging.~~ Um,~~ and if
that is already,~~ um,~~ compromised, suspect those patients are
more at risk</p>
<p>than~~ of,~~ of a macro,~~ um,~~ vascular problem. When,~~
uh,~~ when things go wrong terms of hypotension or blood,</p>
<p>loss,</p>
<p><strong>Barkat:</strong> Excellent. So, can we talk about hybrid thoracoabdominal
repair? ~~Uh, ~~I think Nick will have a question about that.</p>
<p><strong>Greaves:</strong> Yeah. I mean, we haven’t really touched on complex
endovascular repairs yet, but it’s a big topic in itself. The option is
always there. ~~Um, ~~ can you explain when you might choose a
hybrid approach to this thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair?</p>
<p><strong>Jenkins:</strong> so visceral hybrid operation,~~ um,~~ came in really, I
suppose it was this a bridge between open surgery and endovascular, what
it was thought of as being [00:51:00] advantageous. And this,~~ you
know,~~ this, is dated now, this is before custom devices and really
we had so ACIC,~~ um,~~ stents at this time, this was a knee of the
talent stent, which,~~ <del>was a very early through ACIC device made by
Medtronic.</del> Um,~~ perhaps not the perfect name because it wasn’t a
particularly talented, it was a difficult thing to deploy, but it
actually got us into the semester water. And what we realized was that
if you could operate in one cavity IEV abdomen, but still excluding any
wisdom in the chest without costs camping and without rendering that
patient,~~ um,~~ is schemic over a large part of their body. They
could withstand that hit much better than open cavity surgery with cross
and massive reprofusion. So~~ the,~~ the concept of a visceral
height. [00:52:00] Mostly do an expanded Tomoko bypass of a salient SMA
in both renals for me, the display, or to have possible or the I lack
festivals. So they would only get sequential ischemia of one organ at a
time, say the light kidney or the celiac territory.</p>
<p>And during that 10 minutes and estimate versus the remainder of the body
and organs group refused. And at the end that, you could then put in a
thoracic device,~~ um,~~ really,~~ uh,~~ as a freebie, because
you’d already perfused the organs from distally. You’d~~ like~~
gated those target vessels. And then you would just excluding the
aneurysm so that you were transferring blood~~ from,~~ from, above
the repair,~~ uh,~~ to below the repair and retro greatly perfusing
the vital organs.</p>
<p>So it was very attractive.~~ Um,~~ And we started doing it quite
early at St. and initially we had some very good [00:53:00] results in
the first 30 saw patients. And as always,</p>
<p>then it’s allowed you to think of, oh, can do older second patients.~~
Um,~~ but it wasn’t easy surgery. And actually I think because it was
doable in terms of,~~ uh,~~ just an abdominal approach and
relatively familiar territory for anyone who’s done,~~ um,~~
perhaps,~~ uh,~~ occlusive disease for the vessels or renals,~~
um,~~ I think a number of centers started doing small numbers and not
getting so good results. And then when,~~ um,~~ Better custom made
devices came in. I think it’s purpose became less and</p>
<p>less because why would you do, that? If you had an opportunity to
do,~~ um,~~ something which was even less invasive. So what we’ve
been left with now,~~ uh,~~ for, to consider a hybrid type approach
effectively [00:54:00] are those patients who are physiologically not
fit enough for an open approach and those patients who are anatomically
not suitable for a total endovascular approach.</p>
<p>So there’s~~ sort of~~ worst of both worlds in that outcome group.
And so I don’t think you’ll ever be able to compare outcomes
legitimately with the fitter group having open. approach. And they
anatomically suitable patients having a total endovascular.~~ Um,~~
but I must say we still see quite a lot in our MDT coming back.</p>
<p>Who’ve what surprises me is the doability of those,~~ um,~~ grafts
visceral, grafts were main,~~ um,~~ really well paid to do for~~
many,~~ many years. Some of them are 15 years now.~~ Um,~~ yes,
occasionally there’ll be an accessory weaned along a tree or a small
disease doing largely, and the renal golfed go, but the others have been
[00:55:00] extremely</p>
<p>doable.</p>
<p>And even though we’ve had to realign the stenting portion or extend
it,~~ um,~~</p>
<p><del>the,</del> the grafts have maintained really well.~~ um,~~</p>
<p><strong>Barkat:</strong> So moving on to Ty for thoracoabdominal or take aneurism
repair. So these are, can obviously be repaired using endovascular or
open techniques. Can you talk us through your approach to open tie for
repair in terms of exposure and any tips such as how to try to minimize
the visceral ischemia?</p>
<p><strong>Jenkins:</strong> So I think,~~ um,~~ I think an open time for, from a
subcostal approach is a~~ really,~~ really doable and really doable
procedure. And what I mean by that is that the hit to the patient is not
enormous. And we used me fit patient can get through that reasonably
well, you have to be. A little bit selective, but not super selective.</p>
<p>And in my first hundreds I had one 30 day death and one in hospital
death, which was someone at [00:56:00] about three months who just
didn’t get better.~~ Um, ~~so</p>
<p>that puts it into perspective for that actually it’s,~~ uh,~~ it’s
an operation with a very good outcome. If you get it right at the</p>
<p>beginning, the approach I mentioned earlier, nothing too special.</p>
<p>This is a supine patient,~~ uh,~~ getting the bleak on the table in
the right position to allow you to extend. I’ll just illustrate it. And
if you</p>
<p>can see that, so you basically,~~ uh,~~ lower both ends of a table
to break it, to open up that segment,~~ um,~~ to get back to
exposure.~~ Um,~~ I tend to do the vast majority,~~ um,~~ via
subcostal approach.~~ Um,~~ extending that subcostal approach.~~
Uh,~~ some people would call it rooftop on the left side, down below
the costal margin a bit. And then you open up the abdomen a bit like a
certain note and,~~ um,~~ bring that lower segment of incision down
to the pubic synthesis area. And it gives you [00:57:00] really good
exposure.</p>
<p>even if you have to go down to the IAA.~~ Um,~~ it does. cause.</p>
<p>A bit more of a problem getting to the light bifurcation. The left is
easy, because it’s</p>
<p>right there next to you. So that’s an anti-IgE complication.~~ Um,~~
the visceral rotation needs to be done carefully because what you do to
want is to create blood loss right at beginning. And as I mentioned
earlier, it’s getting under the left colon along the white line onto so
S and then getting up under, so S and I always tell the registrars when
they’re doing it, you’ve got to go as far as possible on, so ask from
below. And when you think you’ve gone, as far as possible, you’ve got to
Glen go another five centimeters. So you get right up to the diet. fam.
From below. And then you can get into verse, you have super colic
compartment around,~~ um,~~ the splenic lecture and that’s Lena Rena
ligament and get your fingers [00:58:00] either side of that and take
that off the lateral and the posterior abdominal wall. And the more and
more you do, the more you are freeing.</p>
<p>And then the whole of the viscera,~~ ~~coming up</p>
<p>towards the right</p>
<p>side of a patient.~~ Uh,~~ and eventually they will up and you’ve
exposed. Then the whole of</p>
<p>that left wall available.~~ Um,~~ the first thing I then do is
ensure that I’ve got a camp soon, and I do that by dividing the class.
And sometimes that is really tense at that level. that is,~~ uh,~~
an extrinsic lap around the dilate de water, to extent that there’s a
sort of the dyslexia of across it’s almost ligamentous and~~ it’s,~~
it’s,~~ um,~~ causing a tight band. We oughta, and I tend to get my
finger underneath that before it with a diathermy and it, and then very
carefully choosing the camp’s zone and getting my fingers liked round
that area.</p>
<p>So I know I’ve got a [00:59:00] camp soon. The next thing I then do is
look for the left renal artery, and I’ve already ended to make a
decision about what I’m going to do with the left renal artery. And that
depends on the number of things. So it depends on. To some extent, the
age of a patient wherever left renal is in terms of a clock face, severe
looking at an axial cut to the CT. If you’re,~~ um,~~ if you think
of us,~~ um,~~ cook plan,~~ the~~ more the loft renal is
around~~ sort of~~ before three, o’clock up to two, o’clock the
easier it is to incorporate because you’ve got less aortic there. Once
you’re beyond three 30, run to four o’clock,~~ you know,~~ it’s
quite a long way away and it’s quite post Steria on the sidewall VA
water.</p>
<p>And what that means is then it’s a long way away from the light we’re in
lottery, which means you’re going be leaving a a patch available to
them, which is usually bad news, unless got perhaps a more elderly
patient.~~ Um,~~ also,[01:00:00] for distill left renal is,~~
um,~~ compared to the white renal and all these.</p>
<p>things. You’re making this decision about whether you’re going to try
and incorporate the left renal artery into a big patch or whether you’re
going to actually stay well. No, we’re going to do it separately.~~
Um,~~ and so you’ve already thought about that, but it’s crucial to
find the left renal because when you’ve clamped and you’ve done your
left or tatami, you’ve got to get that day or talk to me underneath
posterior to the renal artery.</p>
<p>Um, so that~~ the,~~ the, older face goes up with</p>
<p>that segment, very water.~~ Um,~~ and</p>
<p>then I tend to get the Ilex out and the left is easy. It’s there. I have
no qualms or the white by going back over the other side of it in Japan,
newly to find the right renal artery to expose that,~~ ~~ I don’t go
around of them.</p>
<p>I just find a very discrete camp zone. You don’t need much just
literally to put a cap on.~~ Um,~~ and then I tend to take off all
that,~~ um,~~ fattened tissue off the [01:01:00] left side of aorta.
So when you opening the auto, you’ve not got a lot of immediate
bleeding.</p>
<p>If you’ve got a veterinary Arctic left renal vein, you’ve got a line
gate that cause otherwise you’d be going through it.</p>
<p>And surprisingly, you know, on CT,~~ um,~~ you may have,~~ a,~~
the main left renal is anterior, but there is often a vein there which
has stretched across so authentic vein, which you could have deal
with.~~ Um,~~ and it’s about getting everything set up before you
cross clamp, because once you cross clamp, the clock is on. So it’s
getting the whole team ready for that moment and making~~ your,~~
your anatomy as perfect as possible before you do that.~~ Um,~~ And
obviously it goes without saying that you have cell salvage and we use
a, a</p>
<p>Belmont,~~ um,~~ with the big bucket on the top of it. So it’s, you
can rapidly~~ give,~~ give blood back when you need it.</p>
<p><strong>Greaves:</strong> So I think you’ve covered a lot of this already, but can
you just talk about what a, what a corral patches and when would you
choose to do a jump [01:02:00] graph? The left renal rather than
encompass all the vessel vessels onto that patch and presume it’s to do
with the clock face again that you just talked about.</p>
<p><strong>Jenkins:</strong> Yeah. I tend to think of a corral patch more in a way with
a type three repair, because with a type three repair,~~ you~~
you’ve done your proximal estimate basis. And then what you’re doing is
you’re putting on a patch of aorta to include the celiac SMA, like to
renal, which tend to be together.</p>
<p>Sometimes the left renal is a bit away. The more tissue you leave there,
the more chance that aortic tissue will dilate to over time. And hence
the patch aneurysms. If your patient has got some form of connective
tissue disease, that’s a no. no. So~~ ~~those patients, we tend to
reimplant directly. So it’s a matte key mech and vein, nice graft four
side bunches already put on and you can go straight onto the off
austere.</p>
<p>So you’re basically leaving no aortic tissue at all for type four.
[01:03:00] You won’t doing an oblique and you have to be aware that the
light side may water</p>
<p>is really left there.~~ Um,~~ and that’s~~ a,~~ it’s a,
compromise,~~ you know,~~ these patients with atherosclerotic type</p>
<p>finer isms,~~ um,~~ they be 60 seventies or even into their
eighties, the good candidates.</p>
<p>They’re not going to live 25, 30 years. And therefore over time that
segment may begin to dilate it.~~ Um,~~ I that is acceptable. Half
of it, a woman, half his deck on the other bit may it, I think if you’ve
got a corral patch, which really balloons out well, that’s something
which different. It, we don’t have good dates as to when those will,~~
um,~~ Give away and rupture. I think what is clear is that if you’ve
got the Hisense between your suture line and [01:04:00] your graft, that
is a dangerous situation, that’s akin to a false aneurysm. And although
it look similar on CT, then that’s a different and they’re at risk at
stage. True. A new Ismal validation of a sacrament it’s left behind is a
bit different.</p>
<p>And I think that’s perhaps a bit safer in essence. What you’re trying to
do is compromise between leaving as literally Arctic tissue possible,
but also getting the patient alive through their first pass</p>
<p>safely.~~ ~~ I tend to, if I know I’m not going to incorporate a
left renal, I will.</p>
<p>So on, uh,~~ uh,~~ uh, six oh eight millimeter assigned branch
onto~~ the~~ tube golf before I start before I cost them.</p>
<p>because that saves, you one, an estimate, SIS. And then now my~~
favorite~~ favorite technique is actually just to amputate the left
win-loss tree and [01:05:00] so directly on then to your bondage and
leave that in a bit of a lazy see in in the,~~ um,~~ power colic,
gutter. So as the rotation comes back, it’s not,~~ um,~~ and
attending. The other technique is to have very short glass light form
your tick,~~ um,~~ prosthetic. But you’ve got to</p>
<p>really judge how that will sit when the kidneys back in its position. So
it can’t come off the anterior aspect of a It’s gotta be further down
and that’s awkward</p>
<p>grudge. And I think we’re probably not good at that.</p>
<p>So the lazy see is a better approach. And I much prefer that to trying
to either reimplant the native artery directly~~ onto a,~~ onto a
deck on. As they tend to resist the nose or to and bring the aortic
sidewall down on to the,~~ um, uh,~~ Daekwon. I think that’s for two
difficulty you’ve got</p>
<p>calcification at the ostium ostial [01:06:00] stenosis, and it’s also
very difficult because you’ve got the rest of your, an estimate is
really closer and sometimes not enough room to bring your clamp down.
And that’s exactly what you want to do.~~ ~~left kidney will take a
bit of an scheming kit, but you want to be perfused the light and the
viscera. You’ve got to have to bring your camp down below your Proxima
and estimates. Have you ever had to treat the corral patch</p>
<p><strong>Barkat:</strong> aneurism and your career?</p>
<p><strong>Jenkins:</strong> Yeah, w we’ve got, <del>you know, a</del> number~~ um,~~ they
tend to be from</p>
<p>previous type through your repairs.</p>
<p>And I think, you know, go into, these are very suitable for, for,
fenestrated or bondage devices. You’ve got a beautiful lending zone,
proximally and distally.~~ Um,~~ why not? The, these tend to be,~~
um,~~ well-suited to that. And it’s a much easier approach mixing into
an open,~~ you know,~~ changing from one to the other. I think
that’s, that’s fine. It’s just at a different stage of a patient’s life
and repair</p>
<p><strong>Greaves:</strong> Fantastic. I think we’ve [01:07:00] given you a pretty,~~
uh,~~ good examination there.~~ Uh,~~ Mr. Jenkins,</p>
<p><strong>Jenkins:</strong> and I get to that’s the question.</p>
<p><strong>Greaves:</strong> you would’ve passed in my books. okay.</p>
<p>there anything that you feel we haven’t.</p>
<p><strong>Jenkins:</strong> ~~Um, ~~</p>
<p>I don’t think so. I think it’s,~~ um,~~ w we have a bit of a tipping
point. with. Open aortic surgery at the moment, certainly in the UK.~~
Um,~~ I think looking at NVR results when NASP ratios, the tipping
back to open now, whether that was as a result of nice guidelines, I
suspect not perhaps that just put it more into focus.</p>
<p>I think people are seeing more problems of patients surviving after,~~
uh,~~ what was very good endovascular surgery at the time. But they’ve
outlived the repair. Now we’ve got problems in MDTs of patients. You
think who got wonder that wasn’t perfect anatomy, should they have had
open surgery? Now the difficulty we’ve got at the moment is the patients
that perhaps</p>
<p>weren’t, [01:08:00] that suits will offend the vascular, did well
initially format and they’re paying the price later on, but those very
patients are the ones that are also more difficult from a, an open
approach. So there are patients with more shorter necks, more torturous,
necks, more calcification. And the concern is that there’s,~~ uh,~~
an a, you have surgeons now that haven’t done as much open aortic
surgery, who perhaps won’t be asking for guidance with adverse anatomy.</p>
<p>And that influences your decision-making. So then patients perhaps don’t
get a full,~~ uh,~~ option appraisal of what is available. And so
the default dentist to go to a less than perfect and do option, which
got to agree it’s less easy,~~ um, you know,~~ to kill a patient
upfront with an endo option.~~ Um,~~ but you perhaps pay for that
later on.~~ Um,~~ and that’s a really weird thing to get around and
we’ve got to get [01:09:00] to,~~ uh,~~ a compromise of finding the
patients with the likely better life expectancy and cohorting them
through. We’ve</p>
<p>got a larger group practice and get them through safely</p>
<p>so they can capitalize</p>
<p>on that. Benefits. And the really lucky ones are the ones that are
anatomically really suited for your friend unless sack really shrinks
and their seals own swimming. Good. And~~ they they’re,~~ they’re
the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>They tend to also be fitter with less, less, extensive disease and get
the benefits from a,~~ uh,~~ less invasive approach.~~ Um, but you
know,~~ we’ve not all patients are the same. We’ve got a now, except
that~~ we’ve,~~ we’ve, gone down the line of working with industry
to what was</p>
<p>really. I suppose rather than concentrate on geo Realty. What they
wanted to do is to extend the applicability, to treat more patients and
get better, lower profile [01:10:00] to allow,~~ uh,~~ patients
probably to go for these percutaneous cardiology market in the states.
And we’re now paying the price of some of those decisions.~~ Um,~~
so we’ve got to, we,~~ I suppose,~~ reboot and take a stone song on</p>
<p>which patients are going to actually benefit from which approach and
have a better evaluation of that going forward.</p>
<p><strong>Greaves:</strong> So I think one</p>
<p>of the <del>sort of</del> question relates to that, <del>um,</del> presumably thorough
capital nine years is a very specialist. The the service delivered in
the UK, you believe a smaller number of centers doing higher volumes is
the way forward.</p>
<p><strong>Jenkins:</strong> Yeah.~~ So, you know,~~ sadly just~~ I’m~~ about
three or four years ago, a lot of work was done on a concept of what are
called locally aortic networks, LA ans and DTA, which are
descending,~~ um, able to~~ thoracic aortic centers. And it was
perceived by the, NHS that perhaps regional networks would exist. And
this is different from hubs and spokes.</p>
<p>This is on a slightly larger level [01:11:00] and these would</p>
<p>feed in and then you’d perhaps have anything between five or eight~~
~~DTA centers up and down the country. And this was to try really and
get a better system for aortic dissection patients initially,</p>
<p>and would include patients.~~ Um,~~ and it was then put on a bit of
a back burner and then COVID came and. um, And Thai bays were taken out
to vet. So a solution was found for type A’s, but it’s now been
reinvigorated. And we’re looking at it again on a slightly different
scale to try and allow that to work a bit better on a national
perspective. I think there are pockets of the country where good
referral pathways exist and those patients,~~ um,~~ get a good deal,
but there were other waivers, your country where there aren’t good
referral pathways and patients really don’t get a good deal.</p>
<p>And [01:12:00] the people are left ringing around patients for hours and
hours, trying to get them in somewhere.</p>

<p><strong>18 May 2020</strong>: <em>Dr. Anna Ohlsson and Dr Sherene Shalhub; University of
Washington</em></p>

<p><strong>What are the common genetic aortopathies?</strong></p>
<p>There are several well-known genetic disorders which account for genetic
aortopathies. The most well-known are Marfan syndrome, Loeys-Dietz
Syndrome, and Vascular Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome,</p>
<p>There are less commonly known ones such as Familial Thoracic Aortic
Aneurysms and Dissections due to pathogenic variants smooth muscle cells
genes such as <em>ACTA2</em>. There are others in which the causative gene is
not known.</p>
<p><strong>Why are they such a big deal?</strong></p>
<p>These are cases in which the building blocks of the aortic wall are
defective. What  I mean by this, is that these patients have pathogenic
variants in the genes that affect cell signaling or smooth muscle cell
structure that lead to suboptimal composition of the aortic wall.  These
alterations ultimately lead to cystic medial necrosis in the aortic
wall.</p>
<p>As such they are at more risk for aortic aneurysms and dissections that
can lead to the premature death of the patient.</p>
<p>To put the frequency in perspective, Marfan syndrome occurs in 1:5000 of
the population while Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (also known as
VEDS) occur in 1:50000 of the population.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s dive into them then – what are the defining features of each
and the high yield information?</strong></p>
<p>The high yield information is being able to pair the genetic syndrome
and phenotype with its associated genetic mutation.  A useful exercise
following this broadcast is to list the disorders in a table and write
out their associated gene mutation, what protein defect or deficit
occurs, the typical phenotype, and the common vascular pathology
associated.</p>
<p>But before we dive in, I want you to keep in mind some of shared
features.  One is that the associated aneurysms and dissections tend to
occur at younger ages and dissect at lower blood pressures than what we
see with sporadic dissections (these are the dissections that are not
familial or associated with a syndrome)</p>
<p>One is that these are inherited in an autosomal dominant matter but
there can be variation in how the pathogenic variants are expressed
among affected people and even within families. The other thing to
remember, is that in roughly half of these cases, the affected patient
is the first in their family to have a given pathogenic mutation. The
flip side of this, is in half the cases, there is a family history of
aortic aneurysms, dissections, and sudden death.</p>
<p><strong>We will start with Marfan syndrome.</strong></p>
<p><u>Marfan syndrome</u> is caused by pathogenic variants in
the <em>FBN1</em> gene (also known as fibrillin-1 gene). These variants lead to
improper formation of the microfibrils that maintain elastin, a key
component of the arterial wall. </p>
<p>These patients are prone to aneurysmal degeneration and dissections of
the aortic root but can also dissect the descending thoracic aorta. They
commonly have lens dislocations (ectopia lentis).  They have common
skeletal features such as</p>
<p>being tall, thin, with long arms and legs, scoliosis, pectus deformities
(carnitatum or exicavtum), and club feet. They can also have a history
of spontaneous pneumothoraces and mitral valve prolapse.</p>
<p><strong>How is Marfan syndrome similar or different from the other genetically
triggered aortopathies that you mentioned?</strong></p>
<p><u>Loeys Dietz Syndrome</u> is similar to Marfan syndrome in all
the features including the aortic root aneurysms. They don’t seem to
have lens dislocation and they have other unique features such as bifid
uvula or cleft palate, and hypertelorism (which is an abnormally
increased distance between the eyes).  What is different about Loeys
Dietz Syndrome from Marfan syndrome is that they can have arterial
aneurysms of other arteries instead of the aorta, such as the SMA,
axillary, or other peripheral arteries.</p>
<p><u>Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</u> has some shared features
to Marfan Syndrome with both such as spontaneous pneumothoraces, but
these patients tend to be short and can have easy bruising. They also
have similar features to Loeys Dietz syndrome in terms of arterial
aneurysms. Common features of VEDS would be thin translucent skin where
you can easily see their veins, thin lips, thin bridge of the nose,
large eyes, easy bruising, acrogeria – or an aged appearance of the
hands</p>
<p>However, unlike Marfan and Loey Dietz, the majority of VEDS patients
tend to not have aortic root aneurysms. One thing to remember about VEDS
is that it is a <em>subtype</em> of Ehlers Danlos syndromes.  It’s very
important to distinguish it from the other subtypes because most of the
other 12 Ehlers-Danlos syndromes are not associated with arterial
pathology. So people with vascular EDS are prone to arterial, uterine,
and intestinal rupture and their average lifespan is 48 due to these
highly morbid pathologies.  25% of patients with vEDS will have
experienced some clinical manifestation by age 20, and that number is
close to 90% by age 40.   </p>
<p><strong>I remember learning about classic Ehler’s Danlos presenting with
hypermobile skin and joints.  Is this something you see with Vascular
EDS as well?</strong></p>
<p>Patient’s with vEDS don’t have the same hypermobile skin or joint laxity
as we classically think of with classic Ehler’s Danlos.  In fact, some
vEDS patients report losing confidence in their physicians who ask them
about joint and skin hypermobility because it suggests to them that
their doctor doesn’t know about their disease process.  These patients
often know more than most of the doctors they meet about their
condition, and it’s a source of constant frustration for them.  It can
also be a problem if the severity of the disease is underestimated, as
we discussed they can present much younger than most patients with
highly morbid issues – like arterial rupture.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned arterial pathology in Loeys Dietz and VEDS. Can you tell
me more about that?</strong></p>
<p>In both types you can see subclavian, carotid, SMA, and iliac artery
aneurysms and dissections, as well as less frequently vertebral, SFA,
and popliteal aneurysms and dissections.</p>
<p><strong>How do you diagnose these genetically triggered aortopathies?</strong></p>
<p>There are clinical diagnostic criteria for each, but ultimately genetic
and laboratory testing is very important for the final diagnosis.</p>
<p>Ghent’s criteria is used to clinically diagnose Marfan’s syndrome. The
big ones are aortic root dilation, known family history of Marfan’s or
not, the diagnosis of ectopia lentis which clinically is manifested as
iridonesis (lens shimmering). Additionally, genetic testing for
pathogenic FBN1 variants is also diagnostic.</p>
<p>To date, there are 5 types of Loeys-Dietz as of last check. These are
due to pathogenic variants in the TGF-B signaling pathway, such as
TGF-beta receptors and SMAD3 genes. </p>
<p>Vascular EDS is caused by a mutation in the COL3A1 gene which encodes a
defective type of III procollagen.  The defect in the procollagen makes
it unable to properly fold into a triple helix that forms the normal
collagen structure.  This causes the defective procollagen to be
degraded intracellularly and as a result there is an overall deficit in
type III collagen which is an important component of arterial walls and
other structures.  The confirmatory test for VEDS is collagen testing
which can confirm the collagen III defect.</p>
<p><strong>How would you manage these patients?</strong></p>
<p>Medical optimization and surveillance is key to try to extend the time
as much as possible before they get a dissection and avoid it if at all
possible. </p>
<p>We start with lifestyle modification.  Avoid “burst” exertions such as
sprinting and weight-lifting.  Anything that very strenuous.   That’s
not to say that they shouldn’t exercise.  Light exercise is encouraged,
but this would be activities like light jogging, swimming laps, or
biking. </p>
<p>In order to minimize aortic shear stress, a resting heart rate of under
70 beats per minute and an exercising heart rate under 100 should be the
goal.  This can be accomplished with beta blockers.  Propranolol has
been shown to significantly decrease the rate of aortic growth in
Marfans patients with a baseline aortic root diameter under 4cm.  There
is research into the use of Losartan in murine models that suggests it
inhibits TGF-beta in the aortic wall, which is an important pathway that
contributes to the breakdown of the wall.  However, randomized
controlled studies have failed to show an increased benefit of Losartan
over beta blockers in Marfans patients.  ACE inhibitors are also being
tested and are shown to decrease the risk of type b aortic dissection
over 6 years.</p>
<p>In vascular EDS instead of propranolol, celiprolol has been studied by
the French and shown to reduce vascular rupture from 50 down to 20% in
vEDS, although the mechanism of this is not yet clear and does not
appear to be necessarily the same as decreasing shear stress as in
Marfan’s syndrome.   In general taking care of these patients involves
trying to minimize complications from procedures and interventions.  For
instance, use ultrasound for any line that is necessary and avoid
arterial lines, intramuscular injections, or other invasive lines if
possible to minimize the chance of a complication.  Patients are advised
to wear medical bracelets notifying that they have vEDS.</p>
<p>We also discuss the importance of forming a care team based on their
needs. This usually includes a cardiologist, a cardiac surgeon, a
vascular surgeon, and a primary care physician.</p>
<p><strong>What about surgical treatment for those who need it?</strong></p>
<p>For patients with Marfan’s, prophylactic surgery is recommended for
aortic root dilation &gt;5cm or thoracic aorta &gt;5.5cm.  Often times the
thoracic and abdominal aorta are involved.  Open and endovascular
surgery are options for these patients. Open procedures often include
open thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repairs, open cardiac surgery for
arch replacement, or cervical debranching procedures.  Endovascular
procedures can include regular TEVARs or branched TEVARs which require
extensive aortic coverage.  Open surgery can be well tolerated and is
ideal in the sense that you can replace the entire aorta which avoids
the future complications from continued aneurysmal degeneration, loss of
proximal or distal seal zones, or device issues that can plague
endovascular methods.  However open surgery, of course caries higher
complication risk and morbidity up front and does share some
complications with endovascular treatments as well.  Sometimes these
patients will have hybrid procedures and often their care will require
multiple surgery teams including cardiac and vascular surgery.  An
important thing to be up front with all of these patients about is that
this is a long term relationship with their surgeon, as they often
require multiple staged procedures, things aren’t fixed in one
procedure, and even after they have been surgically addressed there is a
lifetime of maintenance and surveillance.  Ultimately, the decision for
open vs. endovascular approaches will vary between patients based on
their specific anatomy and arterial issues, what their body can
tolerate, and ultimately what their goals of care
are.<span class="citation"><sup>[<a href="#ref-lumEndovascularProceduresPatients2012a" role="doc-biblioref">417</a>]</sup></span> Some may require having
their entire aorta replaced, while others may only need ongoing medical
therapy and surveillance and it’s important to set expectations early.</p>
<p><strong>What about VEDS, when surgery cannot be avoided?  How do you mitigate
the risk of complications?</strong></p>
<p>The tissue is very fragile.  So using instruments that are the least
traumatic is key – like fogarty clamps for vessels.  Sutures often must
be pledgetted to reinforce them.  Leave no tension on anastomoses or
suture lines.  Always keep a backup plan in mind– when arteries cannot
be repaired, can they safely be ligated or embolized?  Generally any
large bore access for endovascular treatment is avoided because access
site complications are high and can lead to devastating consequences. 
In situations of extremis, like a rupture, these patients’ tissues have
been known to completely breakdown.  Try to avoid the worst case
scenario, but of course sometimes it’s the only option left to get out
of the OR.  Be upfront with the patient about how complications may
arise, set expectations, and think about goals of care early.</p>
<p><strong>We discussed earlier that these aortopathies can have shared
phenotypic characteristics, some of which can be used in a clinical
diagnosis, but are all of these genetic aortopathies syndromic?</strong></p>
<p>Let’s start by saying that all patients with Marfan syndrome and VEDS
can have the syndromic features we just talked about.  However, it’s not
always the case and the absence of these feature does not exclude the
diagnosis.  In fact, we recently treated a middle-aged woman with an
aortic dissection who had Marfan Syndrome confirmed with genetic
testing.  She had been diagnosed prior to her dissection because her
daughter had undergone genetic testing.  However, on meeting her, I
would not have guessed she had Marfan Syndrome, had I not known.  She
was average height, obese, and had no other relevant physical findings
on exam or history. </p>
<p>This ties into another genetic aortopathy that we have not discussed yet
which are the familial thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections.  They
do not have any syndromic features. For example, patients with ACTA2
pathogenic variants that cause alpha actin mutations which again
contribute to degeneration of the arterial wall.  These patients tend to
present 10 years younger than sporadic thoracic aortic aneurysms,
generally in their late 50s compared to late 60s, and women seem to be
less often effected than men. </p>
<p><strong>Dr. Shalhub, I know vascular genetics is one of your passions.  Is
there anything else you want people to remember from this broadcast?</strong></p>
<p>Don’t forget the family.  Once you’ve made the diagnosis in one of them,
remember it is autosomal dominant, so it’s important to make sure the
family understands and that they are set up with the appropriate care
team and monitoring.  They may not all develop the same medical issues,
however as we discussed, ongoing medical management and lifestyle
changes are the key.</p>
