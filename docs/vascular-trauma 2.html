<p><strong>Starting with the basics, what do you tell them are the hard and soft
signs of vascular injury?</strong></p>
<p>The classic hard signs of a peripheral vascular injury are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Obvious bleeding in front of your eyes or even the history of
bleeding in the field - arterial or venous.</p></li>
<li><p>Expanding hematoma - underneath a closed wound/injury</p></li>
<li><p>Profound ischemia of the extremity, determined by the absence of a
palpable pulse or dopplerable signal beyond the area of injury.</p></li>
<li><p>Presence of an audible bruit or palpable thrill near the site of
injury - raises concern for an arterial-venous fistula, often high
flow.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Soft signs of vascular injury by their name or a little more subtle.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>An injury pattern that is often associated with a vascular injury
(i.e. a posterior knee dislocation)</p></li>
<li><p>Diminished blood flow to the extremity, but not profound ischemia,
such as a weak but audible arterial doppler signal.</p></li>
<li><p>Penetrating wound in proximity to a major axial vessel</p></li>
<li><p>Peripheral nerve injuries, as vessels often run in close proximity
in the neurovascular bundles</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Femoral nerve injury - parasthesia to anterior thigh and
decreased hip flexion and knee extension.</p></li>
<li><p>Sciatic nerve injury - parasthesia to lateral leg, dorsal,
lateral and plantar foot and weakness of plantar flexion of the
foot.</p></li>
<li><p>Tibial nerve injury - parasthesia over heel and weakness of
plantar flexion.</p></li>
<li><p>Deep peroneal nerve - parasthesia of first digital interspace
and foot drop<span class="citation"><sup>[<a href="#ref-bulger2014" role="doc-biblioref">429</a>]</sup></span></p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are the initial principles of managing a bleeding extremity?</strong></p>
<p>A lot of times these injuries are, can be very distracting, but I think
the key thing to remember is that these are often poly-trauma patients
likely with other injuries. Certainly the first thing to do is hold
pressure and stop the bleeding, with manual pressure, even placing a
finger into a wound or applying/tightening/adding a tourniquet. Once you
have an effective tourniquet on a bleeding extremity, you can
temporarily kind of forget about it, resuscitate the patient, and
identify other life threatening injuries.</p>
<p><strong>In Rich’s Vascular Trauma Book, they described the injury extremity
index. Could you explain this concept?</strong></p>
<p>If I had to take one tool with me into resuscitation room or an austere
location to evaluate for vascular injury, it would be the continuous
wave Doppler. It’s only more powerful if you can combine it with a
manual blood pressure cuff and together allow one to obtain an, an
objective measure of perfusion. One can slowly inflate the blood
pressure cuff, just proximal to the arterial signal, kind of like taking
a blood pressure and measure the pressure at which the arterial signal
goes away. That can then be compared to a normal or non-injured
extremity. If there is no flow limiting arterial injury, the ratio
should be one or slightly greater than one.</p>
<p>Conversely, if the ratio for the injured extremity is less than a 0.9,
then that’s indicative of flow limiting injury in the artery to that
extremity. If the patient happens to be in shock or cold and clamped
down, the injured extremity index can be repeated 10 or 15 minutes later
as the patient is resuscitated and warmed.<span class="citation"><sup>[<a href="#ref-rasmussen2022" role="doc-biblioref">430</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p><strong>So what do you think the role of CTA is in the workup of extremity
with concern for vascular trauma?</strong></p>
<p>If there are hard signs of arterial injury, often times the patient will
require an intervention without obtaining formal imaging. The question
about imaging often comes into play when there’s a soft sign of vascular
injury, such as a reduced injury extremity index, audible bruit, or
injury pattern. We spent decades saying that the traditional
arteriography was the gold standard, but I think we can say now that CTA
has become the Gold standard for the evaluation of extremity vascular
injury. CTA has improved in quality and it can also get imaging of the
head, torso or other other extremities.</p>
<p><strong>And so whether the patient has a hard sign or a soft sign with a
vascular injury, can you talk us through some of the principles of the
principles of operating on peripheral vascular trauma?</strong></p>
<p>Foremost important to resuscitate the patient and to be mindful of his
or her physiology and hemodynamics. As we said, an extremity vascular
injury can be somewhat distracting. Make sure the patient is being
resuscitated and warmed, ventilator settings are being corrected,
monitoring is in place, which takes a lot of communication with the
anesthesia team, the circulating nurse, the technicians, and the blood
bank.</p>
<p>I think once the patient is set and you’ve got the team resuscitating
him or her then turn your attention to the injured extremity I will prep
that patient widely and be mindful that the incision is likely to take
more than what you think it will. For example, above the knee popliteal
artery, I was still prep that patient from their umbilicus down both
legs, because you need to anticipate getting proximal control or doing
an angiogram at the femoral artery level and anticipate the potential
harvesting of saphenous vein for conduit.</p>
<p>I also leave the tourniquet on and just prep it into the case. Taking
that tourniquet down prematurely can be problematic for a couple of
reasons. It may result in arterial bleeding which in itself can be
catestrophic, but it can also result in hypotension which puts poses
risk to multiple organ systems. So I just prep them into the field and
then communicate with anesthesia tell them when I’m going to let this
tourniquet down. Ensure they are readh, they have blood going and have a
secondary measure to control bleeding as you let that tourniquet down.</p>
<p>For the incisions, they just need to be probably twice as long as you
think they do. You can’t fix what you can’t see and if you can’t see it,
you can’t control it and you certainly can’t repair it.</p>
<p><strong>Do you routinely heparinize all these patients?</strong></p>
<p>I hate to equivocate, but it depends. I depends on whether or not they
have other injuries. So if it’s an isolated extremity injury and the
patient does not have any torso bleeding, head trauma or very extensive
soft tissue injury, then I will then be more inclined to use systemic
heparin during revascularization. If they have any of the above
injuries, then I will use regional heparin flushed up and down the
injured vessel.<span class="citation"><sup>[<a href="#ref-liang2016" role="doc-biblioref">431</a>,<a href="#ref-fox2012" role="doc-biblioref">432</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p><strong>One question that I’ve heard come up a handful of times is can you use
saphenous vein from the injured extremity?</strong></p>
<p>Our teaching, as you referenced, has always been to use a saphenous vein
from the contralateral extremity, but I am quite practical about it. I
certainly have used ipsilateral saphenous vein. If there’s no deep vein
injury and it’s part of the incision and exposure than, than I will use
ipsilateral reversed greater saphenous vein. If there is concern for
deep venous injury or if I have another person to harvest a team member
who can prep out the other leg, then often I’ll defer to that and use
contralateral, I’ll be more deferential to using the contralateral
saphenous vein in the reverse configuration.<span class="citation"><sup>[<a href="#ref-liang2016" role="doc-biblioref">431</a>,<a href="#ref-fox2012" role="doc-biblioref">432</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p><strong>So you have a vascular injury and you have debride it back to healthy
tissue. How do you make the decision between, primarily repair, patch
repair, or interposition graft with autologous vein or prosthetic?</strong></p>
<p>You know, you can picture it now, you have vascular control with clamp
proximal and distal. Now you’re setting up, you really shifting gears
into a different phase of this operation. It’s important to just take a
deep breath, I think at this point and check with anesthesia and make
sure the patient’s doing all right from a global standpoint.</p>
<p>I think the other thing that at this point that I have sometimes
overlooked is the importance of performing a proximal and distal
thrombectomy using the Fogarty catheter. I’ll make sure that I’ve passed
a Fogarty catheter, distal to completely clear the outflow of thrombus.
Then I’ll use regional heparin, 40-60cc of heparin saline down the
outflow before I apply the clamp. I’ll do the same in the inflow that
buys you a little time as you’re sort of thinking about and sizing up
what’s in front of you.<span class="citation"><sup>[<a href="#ref-liang2016" role="doc-biblioref">431</a>,<a href="#ref-fox2012" role="doc-biblioref">432</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>I think my experience the majority need an interposition graft.
Certainly if it’s a grazing wound or a stab wound from a knife, there
may be a role for primary repair or patch, but if one thinks there’s
going to be any compromise of the arterial, arterial lumen or tension on
the repair, then you’re better off with an interposition.<span class="citation"><sup>[<a href="#ref-liang2016" role="doc-biblioref">431</a>,<a href="#ref-fox2012" role="doc-biblioref">432</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>There are some special cases where primary repair might be appropriate.
Veins are much more compliant and you can often get away with a lateral
venorrhaphy. Then sometimes the upper extremities, the brachial artery
has more redundancy. If it’s a very focal injury and you can get a
little stretch, then you will often be able to get brachial artery back
together primarily.</p>
<p>I suspect in the majority of my experience vascular injuries require an
interposition graft. Then in regards to conduit, because most of the
wartime injuries were contaminated and quite dirty, we deferred to
autologous saphenous vein the vast majority of the time. However, if you
are in a pinch, can’t find vein or don’t have time to harvest vein, the
wound isn’t too contaminated and the injury is proximal, axillary or
subclavian, proximal femoral, or iliac, then I think using a prosthetic,
either Dacron or expanded PTFE Gore-Tex is also acceptable. Some recent
civilian literature says PTFE may be better than vein, but that’s not
been our experience in the deployed setting.</p>
<p><strong>Now that we have covered some basic principles, lets dive in a little
deeper on each level of kind of peripheral vascular injury. First we’re
going to talk about junctional hemorrhage, which is an injury in the
junctional area between the torso and extremity, such as the distal
external iliac/common femoral or subclavian/axillary region. These are
some our biggest fears and most difficult to deal with. Can you take us
through a hematoma in the groin or pelvis just above inguinal
ligament–what are the best ways to get control of this?</strong></p>
<p>For the iliac artery or even just the proximal common femoral, I think a
retroperitoneal exposure to the lower quadrant of the abdomen. We
sometimes refer to that as a transplant incision, which is quite
suitable depending upon the injury pattern.</p>
<p>As I alluded to before, don’t underestimate the exposure you’re going to
need. So, if it truly is a groin hematoma, think that this could be
common femoral or external iliac and in those cases, either a transplant
incision in a retroperitoneal fashion to get that controlled up to the
common iliac, or just doing a laparotomy and finding it through the
abdomen.</p>
<p><strong>What if you encountered an internal iliac injury kind of deep in the
pelvis that you weren’t able to control, what are the consequences of
litigating that?</strong></p>
<p>That’s real tiger country, in those cases it’s really damaged control.
One of the things we haven’t mentioned is the important tenant that
maybe arguably one of the most important tenants in vascular damage
control is ligation. We’ve talked a lot about setting up for a vascular
repair, but one of the reasons to check with anesthesia and to assess
the whole of the patient is to recognize that in some scenarios the best
thing is ligation and then dealing with whatever consequences may result
from that.</p>
<p>Keeping in mind sort of life over limb and not being too aggressive
about trying to do some sort of exposure and repair of a vessel that
takes hours and many, many units of blood. So in that context, I think,
if you find bleeding from the internal iliac or hypogastric vessels, I
think ligating those is quite acceptable. There can be instances of
pelvic ischemia um, but if the contralateral iliac artery is open then
that’s quite rare.</p>
<p>Also, often one is dealing with artery and vein injury because they’re
right there together. And as I mentioned, that’s a, that’s a real tiger
country. If that’s happening in those situations, the tenants of
exposure, light, two suctions anddon’t use too small of a needle. That’s
where the SH blunt tip needle on a 3-0 or 4-0 prolene needle works well,
don’t try to be too finesse about this because, in the pelvis, you won’t
be able to see your needle.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s take the same injury and move it now to the external iliac–what
are the consequences of ligating the the external iliac artery and what
are some of your options?</strong></p>
<p>Because it’s the axial vessel to that extremity, I would not like gate
the eternal iliac artery with such impunity. I think in those
situations, controlling it and making that assessment of whether or not
to repair it is paramount. I think that the consequences of ligating an
external iliac artery, are going to be significant and include proximal
extremity ischemia, including thigh, and probably need for above knee
amputation if not disarticulation of the hip.</p>
<p>So I think the external iliac needs to be preserved at all costs. One
can either try that on their own or depending upon how the patient’s
doing or if you are in the field and there are other triage concerns,
whether you reconstruct immediately or use a temporary vascular shunt as
a damage control.</p>
<p><strong>Some can find shunts a little tricky, can you give some advice to
listeners on how to best use temporary vascular shunts for damage
control?</strong></p>
<p>I think it’s important to know what shunts you have available before you
are in this situation. So stroll through the operating room or your
stock room wherever you are when it’s not busy and check out the stock
of shunts. There are four or five different types of shuns, anything
from what’s referred to as the Javid shunt, Sundt shunt, or there’s the
Argyle shunt. Then, you know, there can be makeshift, shuns, uh, such as
small caliber chest tubes, um, and really those, uh, those Sean’s, um,
they’re basically temp the vascular or they’re plastic [00:34:00] tubes
that can be placed into the injured vessel proximate. Uh, and then
control either with a ligature around the vessel to lock that Shant in
place, um, or a rubber vessel loop.</p>
<p>And then that Shant is, uh, we want to make sure that you have, uh,
blown out any clot. Uh, that was a thrombus that was, was there and let,
let some couple of heartbeats blow, uh, uh, red blood through the Shant
and then, and then include it with the clamp, um, and then inserted into
the, into the distal, uh, To the, to the vessel that’s distal to the
injury.</p>
<p>Likewise, uh, trying to make sure that the thrombus has been removed. I
mentioned this earlier from that distal vessel, I think is very
important before you placed the shunt in, uh, so that you try to clear
as much of the thrombus as you can, proximal and distal, and then place
that Shanta in and secure either with, uh, with a heavy silk tire or
plastic vessel loops.[00:35:00]</p>
<p>Um, most of those shunts, you can listen with the Doppler, uh, to you’ll
see arterial flow in it. And you can listen, uh, on the surface of the
plastic shunt with a little, uh, either water or acoustic gel. And you
can hear the, uh, the arterial flow in those shots. And so, uh, just
for, you know, our military docs out there, if they’re deploying to a
role to, and, uh, you know, their supply, Sergeant calls them and ask
them, uh, what, what kind of shunts do you want us to have?</p>
<p>What sizes and what types, uh, what, what recommendations would you give
to make sure that you have on hand? Yeah, it’s a great question for now.
And it’s a challenge for us in the future. I think here and now I would,
uh, I would try to, um, to really make sure that that role to surgeon
put his or her hands on, um, uh, Argyle shunts.</p>
<p>So the, our gal shuns come for in a, in a container. There’s a, uh,
there’s a, a 12 French, uh, [00:36:00] 14 French, maybe a 10 French and
an eight French, all sort of in the same container. And, and I think
seeing those and making sure he’s having. You know, the larger, uh, of
those, um, the 14 French Argyle can work and an iliac.</p>
<p>Um, so that would be one. Um, and probably if you had to go to one and
then maybe look for, uh, uh, uh, also a 14 French chest tube, you know,
to say, well, these are my shut options. I mean, I want these, uh, I
need to have these available. Um, the other shunts, uh, the sun shunt, S
U N D T um, um, the, uh, the Javid shunt, J a V I D.</p>
<p>Those are other ones one could ask for, but then you only have one. Um,
but I think, uh, that’s what I would, uh, those in the thrombectomy
catheters, I think it’s very difficult to do, uh, an effective arterial
repair without the ability to do the thrombectomy, proximal and distal.
Um, because you will be repairing [00:37:00] that segment into
thrombosed vessel with, with thrombosed inflow and thrombosed outflow.</p>
<p>So, uh, I think you kinda gotta get that vascular repair, uh, kit, if
you will, uh, assembled and communicated with your scrub team, um, ahead
of time, uh, to, to include here’s. When I say heparin saline. It’s,
this is the dose I want. Uh, I need, uh, these are gonna be the shots I
might use. Remember to have the, uh, it’s the sh needle, as well as some
of the smaller ones.</p>
<p>Um, um, uh, the thrombectomy catheters, uh, I need these as well, sort
of that series of, uh, of, uh, tools that, that you may, you may find
yourself needing, keep in mind. Uh, you know, we don’t use pulmonary
artery catheter as much anymore, but they can be used as a, as a, as a
thrombectomy catheter in a pinch. And then those thrombectomy catheters
can be used as good proximal inflow control.</p>
<p>Um, you know, as well, you can, you can insert a, um, a [00:38:00]
large, uh, thrombectomy catheter, proximal, and inflate the balloon with
a three-way stopcock and that will afford you. Uh, inflow control in a
pinch as well. So say you’re having a patient transferred in from the
role to, to the higher level of care. Uh, do you recommend, uh, these
patients be happy denies April, uh, when they have Sean’s whether
arterial or venous, if they can be, then, then yes, that’s tricky.</p>
<p>As you can imagine. And it’s sort of similar to can one use heparin for
the arterial repair itself. Uh, and, and that depends upon whether or
not there are other. Injuries a head injury or torso injury, massive
soft tissue bleeding or injury in those cases. Uh, you know, I would not
shut those, but I would not put those patients on heparin, uh, because
you, you, you will cause bleeding.</p>
<p>So our experience is that, uh, the temporary vascular shunts in the
[00:39:00] proximal vessels, which really means, uh, above the knee, you
know, in proximal and, uh, above the elbow and proximal, those shunts
will stay Paden without heparin, uh, for, um, you know, four to six
hours because they’re high flow vessels and. Uh, I was once taught that
the best anticoagulant is flow.</p>
<p>And so if you, if you have high flow and those larger proximal vessels,
the shunts will stay Peyton without heparin. Um, the distal Sean’s or if
they do, if the Sean’s clot off, what we have found is they, they don’t
cause harm when they caught off. You basically are just back to square
one, uh, with the, with the occluded vessel and you have to do the
thrombectomy and, uh, and, and the assessment and repairs.</p>
<p>So even if the shunts do thrombose, our experience has been, at least in
the short term of the shunts or temporary shunts are in two to four or
five, six hours that they do not cause harm when they throw thrombose.
You just have to do [00:40:00] the thrombectomy and assessment at that
time. Great. And just to close out kind of iliac artery injuries, if you
did need to LigaSure either the common or external iliac artery due to
severe injury, what kind of options do you have there?</p>
<p>Well, there are really depends on the patient, uh, their, their overall
condition. If you’ve found yourself having to, you couldn’t put a shunt
in, and for some reason, uh, the scenario was that you had to like
eight, the external iliac, um, you know, that patients are now in a
presumably they are in, you know, they’re in a really bad situation.</p>
<p>Um, and you know, the options you can lie gate temporarily. So I think
one thing to think about while I’m gonna lie gate it, and then I’m going
to get some help. Uh, I’m going to, but in two or three hours, I need
to. You know, I need to now go back and try to re-establish inline flow,
uh, with another set of hands, with more [00:41:00] blood, with a
different surgeon or different lighting or different tools, um, because
leaving it, , you’re going to incur a tremendous amount of ischemia, uh,
into that extremity.</p>
<p>I mean, there, I suppose, are the options of a cross femoral graft. Um,
I don’t think I’ve ever done that in the setting of trauma, you know,
coming, bringing a PTFE graft, uh, from the other, other groin, the
other femoral artery over to the, uh, to the injured femoral artery. Um,
that would, that would be, um, extra, extra ordinary or unusual, but,
uh, and the options are just life over limb and to say, well, I, I can’t
repair it.</p>
<p>They can’t, uh, the scenario, whatever the reason, uh, doesn’t allow me
to establish inline flow and the patient’s going to get an amputation
and, uh, we’re going to work on saving his or her life, uh, and moving.
That is a fantastic advice. Um, as we move our way down the leg, um, I
want to [00:42:00] stop and focus on the common femoral for a minute
here and just discuss sort of the principles of controlling this, um,
options.</p>
<p>If ligation is an option at this level for any of the branches. And
then, uh, is this, you know, in residency that we would talk about in
blast injuries accessing the common femoral to get hemorrhage control,
uh, is this a common maneuver performed in the trauma combat Trump? So
it’s, I think it’s, um, the common femoral is not a whole lot.</p>
<p>It’s not much less consequential than the iliac. In fact, uh, it’s
probably every bit as constantly. As far as like leading it. So it can
be like gated, uh, as a damage control maneuver, but the consequences
will be significant of ligating the common femoral, uh, just as
significant as, uh, as the iliac, uh, external iliac.</p>
<p>So, um, um, you know, uh, you know, there, there’s a couple of ways, you
know, there’s, uh, [00:43:00] there’s, there’s three femoral arteries.
There’s the common, the, uh, the deep femoral and, uh, and then the
superficial femoral, um, No, I think similar to what I mentioned before,
all efforts should be maintained to try to maintain or establish flow
through through those three, uh, if, if at all possible, um, balancing,
you know, the, the, uh, the situation at hand, which sometimes means
I’ve got a ligation.</p>
<p>And, uh, because, uh, because of, of the flow of casualties, because of
the capability I have at a given level, uh, again, ligation life over
limb is, uh, is, is still an important damage control, um, maneuver. You
just have to be ready for the consequences, um, of that and move on. Um,
so, uh, yeah, controlling it. I mean, I think the Fogarty catheters are
useful to control the.</p>
<p>Sometimes you can, from the open common, you can, you can insert a small
Fogarty down into the orifice of the deep [00:44:00] femoral and inflate
that balloon, uh, and control back bleeding from the profundity. Often
there’s two pre-funded femoris arteries. So, you know, they’re difficult
to control there, right?</p>
<p>Adjacent to the femoral vein, um, the deep femoral vein. So, um,
oftentimes controlling those deep femoral vessels from the inside using
the small folk thirties in a three-way stopcock is, uh, is, is quite
handy. Um, and then the same tenants apply, uh, you know, either placing
a shunt, uh, trying to do a primary repair, uh, or, or some sort of
interposition repair.</p>
<p>So the popliteal artery is a, an area that we frequently see injuries
and they can be quite difficult to manage. Um, Can you discuss, uh, just
a little bit about, um, how you best, uh, you know, expose, uh, set up
the patient when you’re trying to access the pump fuel artery, both
above and below the knee. Yeah, I will.</p>
<p>And I skipped a question there. You asked about accessing the common for
[00:45:00] control. I think that’s a acceptable, I mean, it just depends
on where the injury is. Um, I mean, and, and who’s managing the case. I
think if it’s a individual who has not done, you know, 15 or 20 or 30 of
these sorts of cases. And they feel comfortable about accessing the
common femoral to control it.</p>
<p>Um, I don’t think there’s anything at all wrong with that. Um, um, on
the flip side is if it’s a distal SFA, superficial femoral artery
injury, or a popliteal artery injury in those situations, most of the
time it is. Uh, require and should not require, uh, you know, just a
Virgin cut down on, on an uninjured, common femoral.</p>
<p>Um, and, but that just depends, uh, it’s acceptable for sure. Um, the,
uh, the popliteal, you know, I think this is really important, uh, uh,
you know, um, you know, to, to get in flow control to the popliteal. One
has to [00:46:00] expose the above knee popliteal artery, which is
really the distal segment of the superficial femoral artery as it comes
through the adductor Magnus or Hunter’s canal.</p>
<p>Um, I think, uh, you know, starting with a wide incision, uh, or a long
incision, I guess, uh, from above the knee to the mid thigh and, and,
uh, uh, in this case, it’s really, I think, important to make sure that
you have a small sort of bump, if you will, a rolled towels that are
placed underneath the calf so that you kind of prop the leg up.</p>
<p>Frog leg position in a way, and let gravity pull the, uh, a lot of the,
uh, the, the musculature of the, of the leg, uh, down, uh, with gravity
and then find the, uh, the distal superficial femoral approximal above
knee popliteal. Uh, just, just add or beyond Hunter’s canal and then
move the, uh, move the bump above the knee.</p>
<p>Uh, uh, once you’ve got the above knee and then make a medial incision,
a separate medial incision, [00:47:00] uh, below the knee, um, again,
using sort of gravity in a, in a way to pull the gastrocs and soleus,
uh, down so that you can open up that pop bologna popliteal space, um,
and, and, and, uh, you know, make a medial incision that, uh, that
allows you to take the gastrocs and soleus down, uh, and, and right on
the medial edge of the, uh, or the inferior edge of the tibia.</p>
<p>Uh, and sort of, uh, open up that bologna popliteal space, you know, in
this situation you’re going to need Wheatland or retreat. Uh retractors
uh, oftentimes, uh, we have something, uh, uh, called a popliteal
retractor, which, which, um, has, has different depths of, of blades on
the, on the retractor. Uh, there, that’s also referred to as, uh, a
Henley popliteal, retractor, or pilling pilling must be the company that
makes it, but, but those are awfully handy because, uh, you need to, you
[00:48:00] may need very in-depth blades deeper than the, uh, than the
standard wheat Lander retractor things to keep in mind.</p>
<p>And then, and then being able to really put a handheld retraction. Uh, a
narrow handheld retractor, uh, Mike and appendiceal or, uh, uh, Wiley,
uh, renal vein retractor, uh, that allows you to really retract. If, if
you’re above the knee, you not exposure, you can put that narrow
handheld, um, uh, kind of on the inferior aspect of the wound and sort
of toe in and, and really get down into the popliteal space itself.</p>
<p>Uh, if you’re below the knee, you put it, uh, you put that narrow
handheld, uh, in the proximal extent and again, toe in and you really
can try to get that, uh, that, uh, popliteal space itself, uh, exposed.
If you need to, you can join the, the, uh, the above and below knee
incisions. Sometimes the trauma, the, the injuries they’re joined
anyway.[00:49:00]</p>
<p>Um, um, but those are sort of some tenants lighting, you know, can’t be.
Uh, overstated how important lighting is. And sometimes that’s a luxury.
I know, uh, for those who are in a deployed setting, but, uh, um, it was
a sort of the, the, the top line, uh, uh, things I think about with.
Popliteal artery exposure.</p>
<p>Absolutely. Uh, just from one of my own clinical experiences is I
realized, especially in young patients, uh, repairing or bypassing the
popliteal artery, many times these patients have very severe vasospasm
at the end of the case. And you may do a beautiful bypass and really
have minimal, uh, kind of Doppler signal in the foot at the conclusion
of the case.</p>
<p>Um, have you experienced this and, uh, do you have any, uh, kind of
thoughts on this? Well, I think the, um, so yeah, for sure. I mean, so
if the, if the bypass has sort of a above knee to blow me, uh, and
you’ve [00:50:00] excluded or litigated the popliteal injured popliteal
artery, for example, then, um, then, uh, absolutely a lot of times the.</p>
<p>The, uh, the patient will be relatively cold and, and, uh, in a
vasoconstrictor sort of, um, uh, condition. And so, you know, um, I
think, um, as long as you feel like there there’s flow in the, in the,
in the reverse vein bypass, you, you can hear audible flow. It’s not a
water hammer signal, uh, meaning that there’s some diastolic flow in the
arterial signal, and then there’s some sort of weak signal at the ankle.</p>
<p>Um, uh, then, you know, uh, most of the time I will just be done and
warm the patient up and resuscitate them. Um, if any of those things are
not true, uh, you don’t have any arterial signal in the graft, or if you
do, it’s a water [00:51:00] hammer, a signal, um, um, where there’s no,
no signal at all at. Um, or beyond the graft.</p>
<p>Um, then I think you, you gotta, you gotta open it up and, uh, and pass
thrombectomy catheters, proximal, and distal, and get that regional
heparin heparin saline, and really see, make sure that there’s not an
ethical problem, but that’s really a judgment call and it is, uh, it is,
uh, anxiety provoking for sure.</p>
<p>Uh, but you kind of have to have faith. And I do think that, uh, that if
you, if you feel like you, technically, you saw all of your stitches,
you felt like it was good. You had some good outflow back bleeding
before you did the distal. You pulled, you didn’t forget to do this
wrong. Victimy distal. You didn’t forget to do the contract tummy, pock,
proximal, and you’ve got signals, even if they’re spasm.</p>
<p>Um, and it’s just, you feel like it’s not as good as it should be. Um,
uh, in some of those cases, you warm the patient up and resuscitate them
and, uh, and, and the signal will, will. [00:52:00] You can also do an R
on the table. Arteriogram but you know, that in an austere location is,
um, that is, uh, that can be a little bit of going down a rabbit hole
because then, you know, you’ll see, you’ll start chasing ghosts.</p>
<p>You’ll see. Then you’ll see the spasm. And one will say, well, geez, now
I need to intervene on the spasm or, uh, you know, an on table or tear
gram is certainly an option and it should not be discounted. Uh, but I
also think that, uh, you know, I would encourage folks to, as long as
those things are true, you saw your anastomosis, you, you did
proximately, distal, you felt good about your inflow in your outflow.</p>
<p>You’ve got an arterial signal that has got some diastolic flow in it.
It’s not water hammer in the graft, and you’ve got some signal beyond
it. Um, you know, warm the patient up and see how they do. Great. Great.
Um, so as we continue down the leg, uh, we encounter our tibial vessels.
[00:53:00] How, how do you decide on, uh, repairing, uh, tibial vessels
versus just like getting him?</p>
<p>So there’s a great paper. I would refer, you know, you and your
listeners to, um, that was probably it’s published in the journal of
vascular surgery in 2010 or 11. Um, uh, Burkhart was the, uh, I believe
the Gabriel Burkhart was the lead author and it was a review of our
experience, the U S military, his experience with the practice of
selective tibial artery repair.</p>
<p>Um, and when you think about what that means you selective repair means
we, we repair some, but not all a tibial artery. So how do you determine
which ones to repair? That was a good review article in the journal of
vascular surgery that I think looked at maybe a hundred tibial artery
injuries. And what we found from that experience was that, um,
principles of selective repair, uh, led us to F to fix those [00:54:00]
patients in which there was all three tibial arteries were injured,
meaning that, uh, it wasn’t just the posterior tib, but the, but because
of the injury pattern, the parallel had been severed and the anterior
tibial had been severed and there was just no, no flow in the foot.</p>
<p>So in those situations, uh, we saw, we did repair them with a reverse
saphenous vein graft. That’s that’s the exception, the majority of times
as you’re alluding to, uh, and in that case series, we, we did not
repair them because, and we could lie gate the, uh, the single tibial
artery injury, because the others there’s redundant flow, redundant,
arterial flow to the foot.</p>
<p>Um, and, uh, and so you can, um, you can, you can lie gate it, listen on
the table. And if, if the other tibial vessel or two. Uh, his Payton’s,
then it can remain ligated and should remain light gated because you
don’t need to be larger repairs or even more technically challenging.
And time-consuming [00:55:00] absolutely.</p>
<p>Well, thank you. Um, so I think we’re going to shift our focus as we,
uh, begin to conclude the episode here and cover venous injuries. What
are your thoughts? We’ve been talking a lot about the possibilities of
negating our chiller injuries. Uh, how do you approach venous injuries
and legation so I think this is also would fall under the, I would use
the descriptor, I guess, selective repair, which means you repair some,
but not all.</p>
<p>Um, and, and I think the, um, without going into too much detail, it,
it, it depends. Um, so in the extremity, uh, if, uh, I would say almost
all of the upper extremity veins. Can and just should be located there.
There’s not enough muscle mass and flow in, in the, in the upper
extremity veins to bother with repair.</p>
<p>Uh, the exceptions might be a proximal axillary vein subclavian vein,
but by and large, [00:56:00] certainly the distal axillary and the
brachial or basilic veins. So phallic can be litigated, uh, in the lower
extremity. Um, similarly the small veins in the, in the tibial veins can
be and should be located gated. There should be no attempt to repair
those, um, coming approximately in the lower extremity, I guess, distal
to proximal the popliteal vein, uh, and then the femoral vein.</p>
<p>You know, I think that, um, if the patient. Is, uh, physiologically
stable, uh, uh, and, and, and performing a repair is possible or placing
a venous shunt. We’ve had good luck with, uh, venous shunts staying
paid, and then we have deferred to fixing the veins in those cases, uh,
popliteal. And femoral veins, um, not all of them, but most of them, if
the patient is, uh, [00:57:00] you know, not in profound shock and if
the expertise is there and present to do it and there’s operating time
and such, um, then I think, uh, there is benefit to fixing those veins,
uh, at least, uh, and there’s, there’s been studies that, that confirm
that that approach, uh, probably, um, uh, affords better arterial flow,
uh, in the arterial repair because the venous outflow is not impeded.</p>
<p>It does not lead to even if those veins thrombose over time. Uh, they do
it slowly and do not lead to pulmonary. Uh, that’s, you know, our
experience anyway. And so when we can, uh, we will fix those, uh, veins
in the popliteal and femoral segments. Conversely, if the patient, if
the capability doesn’t exist, the surgeon’s not used to that.</p>
<p>Uh, the patient is not doing well physiologically or there’s the need
for the operating [00:58:00] table. And you just gotta, you gotta ligase
it. Uh, those patients, uh, then I think ligating those veins in the, in
the popliteal or femoral segment are also acceptable as a damage control
maneuver. Great. And we couldn’t finish a peripheral vascular trauma
talk without discussing fasciotomy.</p>
<p>Uh, what are your advice, your advice for the listeners regarding. Great
great point. Um, um, and I think we, we are, uh, you know, I think in
the military setting, we’ve been liberal about the performance of, uh,
two incision for compartment, lower extremity, fasciotomy. Uh, so
thinking about that two incisions, we have pretty long incisions, uh,
four compartment fasciotomy is, and I think they should be done, um, um,
more liberally in our setting in the military, uh, because, uh, and so
I, you know, we advocate for them, um, and have shown that they can be
done with.</p>
<p>[00:59:00] Substantial additional morbidity and mortality. In fact,
waiting to do a fasciotomy or missing a fascia otomy has been shown to
be associated with mortality, uh, early, uh, data early from the wars.
Um, so part of that is, is in our system, we often are going to lose
track of these patients. We will see them at a role too, and then we’d
like to think, well, they don’t need the fascia automate the role too,
because they’ll do it at the role three or, uh, we’re not going to do it
the role three, cause they can do it in the role for, but, um, again, we
were going to be evacuating these patients at altitude and uh, and
they’re going to go out of our care.</p>
<p>So I think I err on the side of prophylactic, uh, uh, two incision, four
compartment fasciotomy is in the setting of lower extremity, vascular
injury, certainly wartime vascular. For your time today, and we are
excited to continue this vascular trauma series with you. I really
appreciate, uh, the conversation and congratulate you and your
[01:00:00] team on, on such great work.</p>
<p>It’s a great project. Thank you for listening to audible bleeding. And
we have four more episodes with Dr. Todd Rasmussen coming out over the
next couple of months. So make sure you look out for those both on
behind the knife and on audible bleeding. Thanks for listening.</p>

<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> ~~Um ~~so for the sake of time we’re going to skip the
preoperative workup and description of anatomy and zones of abdominal
vascular trauma So please review this ~~uh kind of ~~on your own
~~Um ~~and just as a side note we’re also going to skip the
management of iliac artery injuries We covered that as part of our
peripheral vascular trauma talk It can fit into abdominal vascular
trauma but for the sake of time we’re going to just jump into a true
abdominal vascular trauma So we’re gonna start out with a little
scenario just to <del>kind of</del> get our feet wet here ~~Um ~~so doctor
asks me it’s in a you have a patient with a gunshot wound to the abdomen
~~A ~~general surgery has already prepped them from the neck to the
knees and performed a laparotomy from the xiphoid to the pubis They pack
the abdomen and temporarily have control ~~uh ~~on what they said
was pulsatile bleeding from zone one ~~Uh ~~can you take us through
~~uh ~~how to get ~~a ~~super celiac control And in a case like
this and in a trauma</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Sure ~~Um ~~so I think ~~uh ~~you know I think
for cases like this ~~uh uh ~~[00:02:00] just a couple of starter
points ~~um ~~you know no case like this ~~uh ~~Should proceed
without you know close communication with the entirety of the
resuscitation team So I think if I was coming into a case like this or
participated in a case like this with you know with our team ~~uh
~~I would start by making sure ~~um ~~that I was on good terms
with my anesthesia colleagues that they ~~Uh ~~knew what we were
~~um ~~facing ~~uh uh ~~in this ~~uh ~~in this situation
that they were pursuing all the key tenants of damage control
resuscitation and ~~uh uh ~~and and all that That means meaning
~~uh ~~you know leading with a blood product or whole blood
resuscitation keeping the patient warm ~~Uh ~~and and all of those
tenants So I would start with that ~~Um and I think as far as
technically um the ~~from a technical standpoint ~~um ~~in these
types of cases ~~uh ~~I will almost always ~~uh ~~you can’t so
what you can’t see and ~~uh ~~I’ll I’ll often ~~uh ~~really
immediately assess my exposure I mean meaning the laparotomy [00:03:00]
So you mentioned that ~~um ~~Laparotomy in this case was from the to
the pubis And and and that’s a great start But ~~um ~~but for the
approach that you have referenced is likely to be needed in this case
~~um ~~I’ll often reset and actually come up a higher go between the
and the costal margin and almost begin ~~uh ~~you know two to three
centimeters of ~~uh ~~Of a of a sternotomy It’s not a sternotomy but
it is at least coming along the SciFest side of the xiphoid and really
release ~~uh ~~thoracic the inferior costal margins of the thoracic
~~uh ~~under the diaphragm so that she can really pull the diaphragm
~~Uh ~~I mean sorry the cost of margins laterally and up so that you
want to suspend ~~Uh ~~your costal margins ~~uh ~~so that you’re
almost suspending the patient’s ~~uh ~~rib cage up in a way from the
aorta and the abdominal contents So I think making a good assessment of
your exposure initially really important Hopefully ~~um ~~you know
[00:04:00] in in in the case ~~uh ~~that I am prepping and in an
operate on these cases I’ll try as best I can to use a retractor Such as
the ~~um ~~that will allow for retractors to really be placed up
underneath the costal margin So again you can spread spread those costs
origins and try to lift the thoracic ~~uh ~~almost lift the cost of
margins away from the abdominal contents If if you don’t have an Omni
you can still make sure that you’re trying to ~~OSE and ~~suspend
that ~~um um superior most aspect or cuddle Or ~~cranium aspect of
your ~~um ~~of your exposure Once that’s done And the other part of
communicating with anesthesia is to see if they have a nasal gastric
tube down ~~Um ~~super celiac ~~um ~~control of or in this case
is almost always facilitated by ~~um ~~having a nasal gastric tube
in the esophagus to allow one to ~~two You know to ~~pop esophagus
~~um um ~~in this area ~~uh ~~and and then be able to get around
that esophagus circumferentially and sometimes place ~~uh uh ~~some
sort of [00:05:00] umbilical tape or sometimes a Penrose drain to allow
for apt ~~uh ~~left sided Retraction of the esophagus away from the
~~uh the uh ~~a cruise that’s surrounding the aorta The other areas
is really mobilizing the left lateral segment of the liver ~~Um ~~so
that that can either be brought cephalad or tucked ~~uh ~~you know
once it’s mobilized can be ~~uh ~~Tucked in in area early and
brought to the right side or the whole portion of the liver so that
you’ve got the left lateral segment out of the way And now at this point
you know one is left with ~~um Uh ~~the cruise that’s overlying the
aorta The other maneuver here sometimes dependent upon the situation is
is put into patient a little bit of reverse Trendelenburg to let the
stomach and and pull that stomach the inferiorally so that you create as
big a window as you can Oh with the esophagus retracted to the patient’s
left ~~uh ~~the stomach kind of pulled down Sometimes you can have a
resident or a an assistant put their hand on the [00:06:00] stomach and
retract it towards the pelvis if you will Sometimes a little bit of
reverse T-Bird helps with that and you can kind of hopefully picture
this So now you’ve got the separated ~~Uh ~~you’ve really The cost
of margin suspended and now you’ve got a window in which you can work
And ~~uh ~~and at this point now it’s ~~uh ~~maneuvers dividing
the skeletal muscle which is the cruise overline the aorta This can
often facilitated with a large right ankle ~~um ~~you know in a
Bovie extender ~~Um ~~and you know in this case ~~um Uh ~~you
know you can almost always see ~~uh ~~that you’re dividing skeletal
muscle over the aorta ~~Uh ~~if there’s a pulse hopefully there’s
even a weak pulse ~~Uh ~~you know one can feel the aorta and just
divide the cruise over the aorta and and try to do some blood dissection
on either side to allow your patient of the spine ~~Um ~~On either
side ~~Uh ~~you know in these cases I typically don’t try to spend
time getting circumferential control of the aorta It’s not like an
elective aneurysm <del>control So or elect bang chrism</del> [00:07:00] repair
where we’ll sometimes get round the entire order and these cases if you
can get on their side of the aorta down fine ~~Um ~~you know that
that is is is what is needed ~~uh and uh ~~and is most efficient in
these emergent sort of cases So up there if you have other questions I
mean it’s a it’s a unexposed which requires you know a comprehensive set
of of ~~uh ~~of things to think about But I’ll I’ll</p>
<p>stop there for now</p>
<p>Do you have any</p>
<p>questions or comments</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong> So~~ um ~~my question is sometimes you’re faced with a
situation of entering a patient sad them and obviously there’s a large
rush of blood and you think it may be coming from somewhere in the upper
aorta Do you think it’s worth taking the time to get super Celia and
control in the in the way that you described before doing a video this
rotation and exposing the order that way Or are there any scenarios in
which you should do a medial visceral rotation first before you do that
So take us through can you take us through a [00:08:00] medial visceral
rotation When did she to want to leave the kidney down when to take it
off sort of the falls and advantages of doing each of those approaches</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Yeah I think so That’s a great question I think It is
worth getting super celiac control If in the scenario that you described
where where you you know the description is a zone one a hematoma that’s
bleeding ~~um ~~and ~~um ~~you know you you’ve got some a little
bit of time you know somebody may be holding pressure or ~~uh ~~but
I do think it’s worth getting super celiac control if you think it’s
from the zone one Now if it’s ~~Uh ~~you know the initial
description was on one and then you get in there and you look and it’s
actually it looks to be from the spleen or or from a different area then
then you can readjust But if it’s truly a a a zone one hematoma that’s
got active bleeding ~~uh ~~then I to answer your question I do think
it’s worth taking the time to get super celiac control ~~Um ~~the
medial visceral rotation of courses [00:09:00] is designed to to ~~uh
~~to to give up ~~Um ~~you know optimal exposure to the left
medial visceral rotation is is designed to give optimal exposure of of
the para visceral segment of the aorta So ~~um ~~that is you know
the the the super celiac segment all the way down to ~~uh ~~You know
to the aortic bifurcation and and ~~uh ~~and and really the left
primarily the left iliac common iliac artery ~~uh ~~initially
although it can be taken across the ORIC bifurcation to see the right
iliac as well ~~uh ~~in this case that that is ~~uh ~~performed
through dividing ~~uh ~~the white line of told ~~uh ~~along the
sigmoid sigmoid colon and the left colon ~~Um ~~and ~~uh ~~you
know establishing this plane and the retroperitonium ~~Um ~~and and
a good portion of this is is steady ~~um ~~you know blunt dissection
~~Uh ~~it’s facilitated with Bovie electrocautery But it it is also
~~um ~~you know there’s a plane in that ~~uh ~~in this area that
is developed <del>with uh with</del> with blood [00:10:00] to section as well
And in the setting of trauma ~~um ~~almost always <del>uh this</del> this
detection plane is taken from the sigmoid the left colon up to divide
the the attachments ~~uh ~~and grained the spleen ~~Uh ~~and and
the left kidney all the way ~~uh ~~to the to the midline and then to
the patient’s right ~~Uh ~~ultimately ~~um ~~and I think in in
the setting of trauma the kidney is Almost always ~~uh uh ~~brought
up ~~uh ~~into this and and and just bring the kidney up I think
it’s generally easier It’s a little bit faster because you don’t have to
take the time to to find that plane ~~uh ~~you know above the left
kidney and ~~uh ~~to leave it down in the setting of trauma ~~Um
~~I would almost always bring that left kidney up</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> ~~Okay ~~</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> ~~if that’s uh yeah ~~</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> ~~Yeah I think that’s perfect Uh one question I have is it
seems like the spleen is always uh getting in the way and always
bleeding at the end of one of these rotations Do you have any tips for
managing uh bleeding from the spleen ~~</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> ~~Well I think this um goes back to I think uh uh my
initial comments and and probably one of the key tenants of of this type
of a procedure is exposure and making sure that if you’re going to
undertake this that you’ve really Gotcha Retractor you’ve got your
incision up along the alongside not just to the XY FOI but along side
the XY Floyd and the cost of margin so that you can really bring that
the left cost of margin both of them and suspend it up Because I think
and in many cases what you described is a result of just not being able
to see well Um and so um you know I think the the best I would the best
tip I could give is is to really try to make sure that uh that your
exposure is as best you can and if you’re compromising on exposure um
you know um which which is easier said than done I I understand that But
uh if you feel like you’re compromising on exposure or retraction um uh
that is uh that that’s uh I think a contributor ~~</p>
<p>~~to to ~~</p>
<p>~~to splenic ~~</p>
<p>~~injury ~~</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong> I have a question Speaking of exposure specifically about
eviscerating the battle I find myself as the as the senior residents
sometimes appreciating actually having difficult and nuances to do this
The way that I’ve learned to do it is kind of taking all the bowel and
finding a lap pad large [00:11:00] enough that’s moist I’m placing some
sort of clamp or something around it and then having someone hold it
outside the abdomen but I’ve always found that it sort of ends up being
clunky or the bowel falls out of the time Do you have any tips on how to
eviscerate and control the small balance situation like this</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> That’s a great question And it is ~~uh ~~it’s it is
very difficult to describe this ~~uh ~~using ~~uh ~~in a
discussion It’s one of those things where you just got to feel it But in
my experience this is the and I hope those who are listening and you can
kind of picture yourself in the situation This is really the the the the
main Purview and job of the surgeon that’s on the patients right So you
can picture in a you’re on the patient’s rights and and it takes a it
takes a ~~um ~~it takes a strong and and I think big ~~uh ~~I
don’t necessarily mean physical but ~~uh ~~it takes a strong and a
big right hand to get that bowel ~~um ~~that ~~um ~~you know
Often and over [00:12:00] and to the patient’s right side you’re you
know you’re pulling it from the left to the right And and I you know I’m
sitting here to describing it and my hand is I’m trying to extend my
hand as wide as I can you know and and it’s ~~uh ~~it’s not a subtle
move It’s not ~~um ~~it it shouldn’t be a rugged but it needs to be
very ~~uh ~~it can’t be done with a gentle ~~uh ~~it’s Until a
type of thing you’ve gotta be strong with it And I don’t use in this
situation I’ll get ~~uh uh ~~operative towels I’ll ask them to
moisten blue towel ~~uh ~~or wet blue towel And you know basically
what you do is with you know with your left hand as you take that blue
towel and you put it underneath your right hand which has the viscera in
it and you know you sort of You tried to get it down at the base so that
you really that blue towel here and your right fingers are coming across
the aorta you know ~~um ~~cause you’re taking it from the you know
from the patient’s left to the patients to the midline and then
[00:13:00] try to get it over to the right and then put this big blue
towel this wide blue towel ~~Um ~~you know underneath your fingers
~~uh ~~and then you know lay it out and and ~~uh ~~then
hopefully I mean this is where I I actually like in my situation or in
my preferences to use the Omni ~~Uh ~~but you’re going to need big a
wide you know retractor ~~Uh ~~that’s going to take the place of
your right hand That’s going to now come in on the top of that blue
towel And ~~uh ~~and hold all of that and maybe a couple that hold
that visceral you know to the patient to the right of</p>
<p>the patient’s Midland</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong> That’s one of those maneuvers that I feel like is very much
easier said than them and I’ve been</p>
<p>humbled by it</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> it’s very difficult to describe</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong> ~~I want to just ask a follow up question about the middle
of the medial visceral rotation that I asked her My question just to
clarify question is is there ever a situation in which you’re faced with
a bleeding error where because of the time it takes to get super sealing
I control that you would rather do a visceral rotation and be controlled
being on it that way Or is your approach always Basically without fail
too if you have a high aortic injury to get your con control and then
immediately rotate the viscera and expose the order that way Secondly
~~</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> ~~Well I think there’s um great question I mean I think
that if you um there there are scenarios where if you if you If you feel
like uh you know you see the bleeding let’s say um you know it’s zone
one and all of a sudden you you know you’re getting ready to do this and
you see that it is a spurter from the SMA you know a superior mesenteric
artery and it doesn’t look like it’s the aorta for example And because
there’s some structures of course in zone one that aren’t I mean
obviously they’re not some are not the aorta So uh I think that the
scenario that you would Um forego super celiac control uh would be a
scenario in which you you made an observation that you felt like you saw
the bleeding It wasn’t necessarily from the aorta and you felt like you
could kind of get it controlled Locally you know without having to
occlude a inflow from the aorta So but that um if it’s unknown you know
and you have the you had just uh you don’t know where it’s coming from
in zone one I think short of that I would um advocate for trying to get
a super celiac control ~~</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Great ~~Um ~~so when we talked to the left medial this
rotation for our kind of med students out there we’re we’re thinking
that there’s likely an aortic injury or a a a branch close off the aorta
~~Um ~~sometimes you’ll need to do a right medial visceral rotation
though ~~Um ~~and that’s generally when you’re kind of worried about
either ~~um ~~generally a [00:14:00] IVC injury ~~Um ~~so Dr
said can you just take us through a few of the nuances of a right medial
Chris rotation</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Right So this is ~~um ~~you know this from obviously
from the other side and this involves dividing the the White line of
toll ~~um ~~starting often at the and the coming along the right
colon and bringing the ~~um ~~you know the Sikh ~~uh ~~cephalad
and and ~~uh ~~and the entire right colon ~~uh ~~you know to the
patient’s left now and then cephalad it’s I’m surprised ~~uh ~~most
of the time in these cases it’s actually Not so much a ~~uh
~~rotation to the mid line and then the left as it is ~~uh
~~bringing everything up cephalad to almost to the patient’s left
costal margin for example They really are almost bringing the CQM and
the and the right colon ~~Um ~~You know to the up onto the patient’s
left chest in a way ~~Um uh ~~and and this is a plane that also
similar to the medial visceral rotation ~~uh ~~on the left
[00:15:00] side This is a plane that is largely developed ~~uh
~~with blunt ~~uh ~~dissection It’s a combination Once the the The
parent Niamh retroperitoneum has been opened with with ~~uh ~~some
Bovie electrocautery ~~uh ~~than than the plane should develop And
in this case ~~uh ~~you’ll see almost immediately the the left iliac
vein ~~uh ~~and then the vena cava And ~~uh ~~and you continue
to bring ~~um uh ~~the the left colon up until you see the the left
renal vein or I’m sorry the right renal vein and ~~uh ~~and the
kidney And ~~um ~~And and you know it did it’s superior extent This
will ~~um ~~of course ~~uh ~~expose the head of the pancreas the
duodenum and the head of the pancreas And ~~um ~~similarly ~~um
~~You know this the visitor in this situation I get a ~~uh ~~a wet
blue towel or operating towel I guess it can be white towel but I don’t
really like to use a lap sponge cause it’s too small and it doesn’t
quite have enough substance And you will one will ~~um ~~you know
place that that [00:16:00] Blue operative towel down along your fingers
that are bringing this this all of the vis are up so that you really get
it all partitioned away with with a substantive ~~uh uh ~~operative
towel ~~Um ~~and that that has to be then you know cold in ~~uh
~~with a large retractors so that your hands are free to actually
operate</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Perfect ~~Uh ~~one thing I just want to remind some of
our residents in medicines out there is I I would really go onto YouTube
after this and just look up ~~uh ~~left and right middle vis
rotation that’ll really help solidify these points It’s one thing
hearing it but I think if you watch some videos on it I think it’ll
really help bring it all together ~~Um and if you also want to ~~</p>
<p>~~hear ~~</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Yeah I think I was going to say the same or to obviously
have an Atlas but are you know something because it’s it is you got to
kind of combine I think ~~uh ~~the word ~~uh ~~that we’re
talking about here with with some sort of visual aid the end the thing
that I would recommend and make a point ~~um uh ~~is for those who
have the opportunity to assist with spine exposures So ~~uh ~~in
these maneuvers that [00:17:00] we often perform as ~~uh ~~assisting
our orthopedic or neuro surgical colleagues to ~~uh ~~expose ~~uh
~~do anterior exposure to the spine ~~Uh ~~many of these maneuvers
we’re talking about are performed in the spine exposure which which
sometimes can be overlooked by trainees And and and even They sometimes
is well that’s not a very good operation You don’t really get to ~~uh
~~so and and it’s not really a basket operation Boy I’ll tell ya
~~Um ~~high exposures are a great way to begin to ~~uh ~~nerve
or learn the tenants of of of rotating the visceral ~~uh ~~either to
the right to the left and exposing the retroperitonium</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong> I think also ~~um ~~procurements have been extremely
helpful for liver and kidney ~~Um ~~this right sided rotation Is it
usually the first step of any procurement And then you’re kind of seeing
the entire intro part IOM So it’s also a very good opportunity to learn
some anatomy</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> ~~Absolutely And uh ~~</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Great point</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong> ~~Um ~~we haven’t discussed the ~~uh ~~infer renal
aorta yet [00:18:00] I think probably a slightly more straightforward
approach but can you discuss your technique for inferiority exposure and
then talk about I’m kind of coming across the renal vein when you can
like gate it how to get it out of the way things like that</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Right So the the most ~~um ~~You know the most common
and maybe most straightforward exposure is what we refer to as a you
know transperitoneal and from he’s a colleague ~~um ~~exposure of
the ~~um ~~the infer renal aorta ~~Uh ~~you know this here again
people ~~uh ~~who are listening and looking ~~um uh ~~either at
a videos or or ~~um ~~or an Atlas kind of recommend or recognize
that ~~uh uh ~~the infer music colleague ~~Um ~~means that the
transverse colon is ~~um ~~reflected cephalad and ~~um ~~it’s
one of the first moves is to really hold up the transverse colon ~~um
~~in the patient’s abdomen and and drape it up You know cephalad
almost on the patient’s costal margin And often ~~uh ~~you
[00:19:00] know I’ll set initially set a retractor Now that also goes
into a big to me is is partitioned with a ~~uh ~~operative towel a
moistened or wet operative towel to get the transverse colon ~~um
~~and retracted cephalad ~~Uh ~~and then the next move is to
divide the ligament of Treitz ~~Um ~~and this to me is always also a
maneuver that’s led by the surgeon on the patient’s right ~~Um
~~whether that’s the primary surgeon and the ~~uh ~~the attending
or resident ~~uh ~~however you’re configured this this maneuver
~~uh ~~dividing the ligament of Treitz and and getting the you know
fourth portion of the denim which is to the left of the midline in a
dividing that ligament of Treitz that peritoneum and and and bringing
that over to the patient’s right ~~uh ~~is is the next move ~~Um
~~and and that begins this ~~uh ~~Process of you know getting
really the the bowel Now ~~um ~~in this case the the left colon is
left ~~uh ~~remains to the patient’s left [00:20:00] but you’re
bringing all all bowel to the patient’s right ~~Um ~~this this is
not a medial visceral rotation of of the entirety of the viscera This is
only bringing the duodenum the fourth portion of the Dudina and all of
the small bowel Partitioning it to the patients Right And and this also
again if one can visualize this be done by the patient the surgeon to
the patient’s right and the right side of the patient bringing that
small bowel all the way across This also takes a wide and broad and
strong hand This can’t be done with ~~uh uh ~~I don’t know how else
to say it It’s just a broad and strong sort of ~~Uh ~~maneuver with
with the hand to bring this across and then and then partition get
another wet blue towel I keep saying blue I guess it could be white but
operative towel and Yeah Put that towel over your fingers And you know
as you bring the small bowel over that’s the ~~uh ~~infer renal
aorta ~~Um ~~you know this [00:21:00] positioning Then retractors
one will you know at the most cephalad extent of that ~~uh
~~exposure begin to see the left renal vein ~~Um ~~at the at the
root of the of the colon mesentery ~~Um ~~and ~~uh ~~you know at
the at the caudal most portion of this you’ll see the aortic bifurcation
~~Um ~~and ~~um ~~you know that’s that’s sort of the extent of
this The ~~um ~~the ~~uh ~~the the left renal vein Mmm Hmm Can
be like ~~uh ~~if if it if it facilitates aorta control ~~Um
~~obviously if one is going to locate the left renal vein it’s it’s
optimal to leave the ~~um ~~the branches of the left renal vein So
the gonadal eh the ~~uh ~~the lumbar vein which also often will
drain the left kidney and then the the ~~uh ~~the gonadal So if
those are left intact dividing that left renal vein ~~Uh ~~can
usually be accomplished without causing a significant detriment to the
left kidney ~~Um ~~I will say that dividing the left renal vein is
easier said than [00:22:00] done I mean it’s it is ~~uh ~~you know
it’s a thin wall structure which of course ~~uh ~~can bleed
significantly itself So you know these are all Sort of ~~uh
~~decisions that have to be made depending upon what what Andrew
you’re dealing with and and the extent of your exposure</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong> ~~Um ~~I think one question I forgot to ask you earlier
was I think Infor renally they are it is a little bit easier to get
around completely input you know an umbilical tamper a vessel loop
around But like you mentioned earlier Super celiac area That’s a lot
harder to do when sometimes the goal is not to always do that but you
have tips on how to do that Because again I’d been humbled by that I’m
in a procurement one time when the attending allowed me to try and get
around it and I tried to bluntly with my fingers to get around the
posterior Huerta and had a lot of trouble So do you have any tips about
that</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Well I think this is ~~um ~~I mean this is just takes
~~um ~~you know experience and and ~~uh ~~and And ~~uh ~~and
and time I mean I in my own mind as I see this I I ~~uh ~~you know
[00:23:00] this is a combination of ~~uh uh ~~sort of ~~uh ~~a
little bit of Metzenbaum scissors a little bit of kind of pushing ~~uh
~~you know cause what you’re trying to do is to to to to free the
aorta from from the connective tissue around it to get back to the spine
You know ~~uh ~~sometimes ~~uh ~~actually almost always I’ll use
a metallic Pediatric yang cower That is sort of one of my the suction or
dissection tools of choice is is <del>pediatric</del> Yankauer which is small
and profile It’s got a blunt tip It will you know it is a suction device
And so that’s useful ~~Um ~~and you know kind of this combination of
pushing ~~Uh ~~a little bit of maths here and there Metzenbaum
scissors ~~Um ~~and and a little bit of feeling with your finger so
you can get that connective tissue aorta freed ~~Uh ~~and then you
know you can begin one can begin to ~~um ~~to ~~uh ~~you know
use a right angle a big right angle and ~~uh ~~and ~~uh ~~try
<del>to uh to uh you know</del> to get underneath it Obviously what you’re
looking for here in [00:24:00] part is ~~uh ~~is a Is lumbar you
know you’re looking for the lumbar vessels which you know those are the
things you need to leave behind for at least by as we tell our residents
you know find the outside before you find the inside ~~Uh ~~you can
find them outside before you find the inside of a lumbar Then you can
clip it ~~Um ~~you know ~~uh ~~another I think very useful tool
in this situation is is having large Weck cliffs you know ~~uh
~~because you’re not it’s very difficult to pass you know a silk
~~uh ~~to lie gate a lumbar And in these situations a lot of times
you know you need those large WEC medium to large Weck clips ~~uh
~~to ~~uh ~~help you know get on either side of a of a lumbar
artery or vein</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> ~~Great Uh ~~one quick point back to their renal vein I
kind of picked this up just as fast past week is you can really get a
lot of mobilization on the renal vein just by ligating some of the
smaller branches ~~um ~~out distantly on it not even the gonadal but
sometimes the adrenal vein and a few of those veins And you can really
get ~~uh ~~you know five centimeters a [00:25:00] mobilization of
that renal vein which should give you enough distance to clamp ~~Um
~~But now we’re going to go into ~~um ~~each vessel off the aorta
I know this isn’t exactly what you’re going to see in a trauma You don’t
have isolated celiac artery injury or isolated SMA injury but just for
the sake of learning we’re going to talk through each vessel and talk
about the options of exposing it and then repairing it So starting
approximately a Dr. Rasmussen ~~um ~~can you discuss ~~uh ~~what
the best ways to see the celiac artery are and ~~um ~~any options
for repairing it</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Yeah So the you know the celiac artery ~~um ~~I guess
the origin of the celiac artery ~~um ~~can be seen either through
the lesser SAC ~~Uh ~~this is again ~~um uh ~~through ~~uh
~~you know an an sort of a I guess an anterior approach ~~uh uh
~~through the stack ~~Um ~~and this is ~~uh ~~would likely be
~~uh ~~very similar to the exposure we talked about ~~uh ~~with
a super celiac aortic exposure where the cause retracted ~~uh ~~you
know caudally down towards the pelvis ~~Um ~~[00:26:00] and ~~um
~~You know that opening lesser sack and pulling the stomach down and
and sort of getting the pancreas to come down That will expose then the
the origin of the first centimeter to the celiac artery If the proximal
segment of the celiac artery is injured and bleeding then then the
repair options ~~um ~~you know I I think lend into the category of
any vascular know major vascular three If it can be prepared repaired
~~uh ~~primarily ~~uh ~~then you know using ~~uh uh Uh
~~four Oh five Oh proline future If it does a grazing wound and
repairing it primarily ~~uh ~~can be done then then that’s that’s
one option ~~Uh ~~if it’s a large ~~um ~~you know ~~uh uh
~~celiac artery injury that that cannot be repaired primarily and
there’s destruction of the wall Oftentimes you’re an individuals in a
dam Really a damage control situation there And repair is not so much
Your first a lot of thought You’re [00:27:00] really situation trying to
just control bleeding and save patient’s life And and so in those cases
you know ~~uh ~~controlling the celiac artery and even consider you
know ~~uh ~~ligating it may be necessary ~~Um ~~you know as a
damage control maneuver at least initially ~~Um ~~the other way to
see the origin of the celiac artery is still left medial visceral
rotation So the maneuver we described before ~~uh ~~will show the
entire we’ll expose the the para visceral segment of the aorta</p>
<p>~~um ~~to include the first centimeter to the celiac artery</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong> ~~Uh ~~so ~~uh ~~any keys to identifying the common
hepatic artery and again ~~um ~~thoughts on ligation strategies and
repairs</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Right So I think the ~~um uh ~~you know I think I
mean the common a paddock you’ll need to that will not be able to be
visualized through the left medial visceral rotation ~~uh ~~that the
common hepatic and getting out into ~~Uh ~~the [00:28:00] segments
there of of the of the the major branches of the celiac ~~uh ~~one
we’ll need then in that case to be coming from a you know a transparent
to Neal you know ~~uh ~~anterior approach with a lesser SAC And you
know di ~~uh ~~identifying the common a paddock ~~um ~~you know
is is ~~um ~~Mmm You know requires sort of a recognition of where
the celiac artery is You’re in the lesser SAC The stomach really has to
be Ah inferiorly This is again if you find yourself operating in this
space you know the <del>the the</del> costal margins as I said to begin really
have to be flared And almost suspended up ~~Um ~~so that you’ve
really opened this Sometimes reverse Trendelenburg is useful ~~Uh
~~getting a hand a resident or a med student’s hand to pull the
stomach down ~~um ~~and open up that that that space ~~Um um
~~it you know that that will then should expose then the you know the
the the second and third segments of the celiac and its major branches
to include the common [00:29:00] hepatic artery</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Great And so ~~uh ~~as far as like getting the common
hepatic artery how does the GDA play into this ~~And ~~by that I
mean the gastroduodenal artery</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> I mean you know the ~~uh ~~the the the GDA is as I
guess is most commonly the case is you know and and listeners know is
Really one of the first or the first branch of the common hepatic artery
and and really defines the junction between the common hepatic and
proper paddock arteries ~~Um ~~and I think ~~um ~~I mean ideally
~~um ~~The common hepatic should should not ideally you don’t want
to legging any of these arteries right So I think that we start with
that premise to say geez if we can get a repair done that’s going to be
our that’s going to be ~~um ~~option a ~~um ~~whether that’s the
common hepatic proper paddock or GDA ~~uh ~~just like any artery in
the body like 18 it may be required as it is a damage control maneuver
~~Uh ~~just to ~~uh ~~control hemorrhage ~~Uh ~~[00:30:00]
let the patient recover a little bit talk to anesthesia and sort of see
how things are going Make an assessment of of of the region distal to
where you’ve liked it So so this is just a basic tenant of ~~uh
~~like aiding any artery in a damage control situation ~~Uh ~~we
recognize no matter which artery rely gating ~~Uh ~~the consequences
~~uh ~~of that ligation or we need to assess those consequences and
then and then address them if we’re able if patients you know able to
~~um ~~to move to the next step So ~~um ~~obviously liking the
comment of paddock distal to the GDA likely to Render you know ~~uh
~~a significant portion of the of the duodenum the pancreas and and
then the liver is schemic ~~Um ~~and so you know if the light
station can occur proximal if the injury is proximal to the GDA ~~um
~~then you know that would and G and perfusion can be maintained into
the GDA then that’s that’s preferable[00:31:00] ~~Um ~~but if I was
in one of these situations or when I am And we find ourselves having to
like ate it or we like hated it We didn’t quite know cause we didn’t but
we had to you know I was bleeding and there was a clip when we had a
damage control over ~~Um ~~and now Jeannie or the common paddock or
the proper paddocks lie dated Now what I usually will talk to anesthesia
We’ll get the patient as resuscitate as we can We’ll get out the Doppler
we’ll make an assessment because you know dependent upon patients can
tolerate but depending on the resuscitation status ~~uh ~~collateral
~~uh ~~where your legation is ~~Um ~~you know they may be able
to tolerate having any one of those vessels legged If on the other hand
without your Doppler and ~~uh ~~you get the patient resuscitate as
possible and there’s clear aschemia then you’re going to be faced with
the decision whether or not we need a reconstruct ~~uh ~~the this
leg vessel shunted ~~um ~~or ~~uh ~~you know it may be situation
where you have to deal with the metabolic consequences and leave the
[00:32:00] leave at like eight There’s not one answer You know that I
think there’s a there’s not one answer that applies to all situations
It’s a I think it’s a learning and adhering to the principles of damage
control resuscitation and damage control surgery</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> ~~Absolutely Um so off the record dr real quick I think you
miss uh said the distal and proximal cause you can lie gate the uh you
can like it The common a paddock Proximal to the GDA because you’ll have
retrograde flow from the GDA into the proper hepatic Right Um could you
just say that sentence and uh one more time and then ~~</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> ~~Sure what I guess what I’m what I’m meant to say And
I don’t you know uh actually looking at a diagram so I can try to uh see
the so what I meant to say is that you can often lie gait the common
hepatic um uh proximal GDA keeping a retrograde filling into the GDA and
maintaining a viability of the Dudina and the pancreatic head ~~</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Perfect Thank you Okay And now let’s dive into the ~~Um
~~and this is you know very close in proximity to the celiac artery So
many of the options to visualize it will be the same but there’s some
unique differences A is with its relationship with the pancreas ~~Um
~~so briefly doctor asked me Jason ~~uh ~~what are our options to
see the SMA and ~~uh ~~and and do we kind of think of SMA kind of in
portions a little differently than ~~uh ~~some</p>
<p>other vessels</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Definitely So the ~~uh ~~the SMA ~~um ~~you know
the the the pathway really to see the first centimeter to the SMA
superior mesenteric artery is is through the left medial visceral
rotation which will which will show the entire pair visceral segment of
the order ~~uh ~~including [00:33:00] for centimeter two of the
superior mesenteric artery If ~~uh ~~If more exposure needs to be
~~um ~~you know if if one is trying to expose more distal segments
of the SFA then ~~Uh ~~one probably have to go back to the anterior
approach not the left mijo visceral rotation ~~uh ~~and go through
the approach And in this case then the the superior mesic Terrick artery
is of course closely related to the head of the pancreas And and ~~uh
~~and ~~uh ~~and and so in this situation that the head of the
pancreas ~~uh ~~Well it needs to be you know ~~um ~~divided or
you know the the SMA is closely adherent to the head of the pancreas in
this case distal of the segment of the superior mesenteric artery distal
to the pancreas is often now ~~uh ~~best seen in an infra And these
a call like approach And this ~~uh ~~this is the superior mesenteric
artery exits the second segment ~~uh ~~and its relation with the
[00:34:00] pancreas and comes out into the the root of the mesentery and
~~uh ~~into the ~~uh ~~into the ~~uh ~~the small bowel This
is where for example <del>Mmm Mmm</del> One with lift the transverse colon
cephalad as we described before ~~um ~~and and retract the small
bowel to the patient’s right and see the the the root of the SMA ~~Uh
~~below ~~uh ~~and and inferior to the to the transverse colon So
yes there there are these ~~uh ~~stink segments of the superior
mesenteric artery ~~Um ~~expose Each of those segments ~~um
~~has a little bit of a different ~~uh ~~anatomic approach And and
then ~~uh ~~and each of those segments has ~~um ~~you know I
think considerations that are important that relate to surrounding
structures you know whether that’s the obviously the pancreas ~~uh
~~the root of the transfers colon ~~um ~~</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> thank you for taking us through those complicated anatomy of
the SMA as it kind of traverses the abdomen ~~Um ~~you know in
[00:35:00] all of these vessels obviously we you know primary repair is
kind of our our our first option if possible And then many times you may
need to interposition graft ~~Um ~~Just you know I know this is a
question that is very case dependent is there a portion of the SMA that
you can lie gate and or is a is SMA just a no</p>
<p>ligation zone throughout</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Well that’s a great question And ~~um ~~I think
similar to other other large axial vessels or arteries ~~um ~~you
know the more distal segments is just going to be better tolerated than
like eating the you know the proximal proximal segments So ~~um
~~You know I would not say it’s a no ligation zone in its throughout
its entirety ~~Um ~~but I do think ~~um ~~you know that if
possible ~~um ~~efforts should be maintained or efforts should be
undertaken to maintain flow through the SMA through you know through
through its entirety ~~Um ~~and you know repairing the SMA
[00:36:00] just it depends upon the injury ~~Um ~~if it ~~uh
~~is a small grazing Wound Then ~~um uh ~~then you know perhaps a
primary repair can be undertaken with a ~~uh ~~FORO or a five O
proline suture ~~Um um ~~if it’s a more substantial wound ~~um
~~and and one can get it controlled ~~um ~~and and isolate it
~~uh ~~you know ~~uh ~~than than repair can be ~~Um
~~Undertaken with a patchy angioplasty or even an interposition graft
That’s pretty rare And because those wounds are just so mortal ~~um
~~it’s very different You know patients who have those sorts of ~~uh
~~axial injuries at the proximal portions of these message check
vessels typically don’t survive ~~Um um ~~And so you know it’s very
difficult I I can’t think of a time when I’ve necessarily been repairing
for trauma the proximal segment or two of of the SMA ~~Uh ~~it’s a
little bit different for an elective tumor resection atherosclerotic
occlusive disease and such But ~~uh ~~for trauma[00:37:00] ~~Um
~~you know it’s it’s ~~uh ~~it’s pretty uncommon to be ~~uh
~~doing extensive repair of of these SMA segments I don’t I don’t know
what your experience is or our thoughts are on that</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong> I certainly have had zero experience preparing SMA injuries
~~Um ~~but</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> ~~Yeah I think it’s just pretty uncommon ~~</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong> ~~Um ~~I know that ~~uh ~~like you said in her
position grafting is probably more theoretical than realistic in a
situation like this But can you talk about the technique for it Maybe it
may be useful for other types of situations but ~~uh ~~what what
what material are you using where you’re where you’re bringing the graph
from and how you tunnel it</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> I was just going to say I think you guys are exactly right
And and and Adam and I both experienced this is yeah many times we’re
not seeing traumas with these injuries but many times we’re getting
called by the surgical oncologist with a kind of <del>can’t</del> cancer injury
to these vessels And so I think when we’re discussing SMA we can kind of
keep it in the perspective of how do we replace it if we need to ~~Um
~~and in the situation where they need to do some larger sections So
with that in mind a doctor asked [00:38:00] can W can you tell us how
you would bypass it</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Yeah So I think that the ~~um ~~I think that in these
cases you know and as I said in a rare situation ~~uh ~~in the
setting of trauma if you’ve if you’ve or able ~~uh ~~to establish
proximal and distal control and side-branch control of this segment and
~~uh ~~then you know your options for reconstructing it ~~um
~~with an interposition graft ~~um ~~you know would would include
using a prosthetic like PTFE or Dacron ~~Uh ~~or an autologous
tissue like vein And here it it just it depends ~~uh ~~it depends on
how prepared you know you are with the with patient for example as a
patient prepped ~~uh ~~where ~~uh ~~the one could harvest either
the very proximal segment of greater saffron is Fein or or a segment of
deep femoral vein which which may ~~um ~~actually ~~um ~~You
know have a better size match to the proximal portions of the SMA ~~Um
~~and and if that’s the [00:39:00] case you know if there’s Interra
contamination either from a tumor resection or from an injury than it is
preferable of course to to use autologous ~~uh ~~conduit such as
deep vein deep femoral vein a small segment of deep femoral vein ~~uh
~~or if the if the saphenous at its proximal extent is It’s large
enough ~~uh ~~you can one can use that ~~Um ~~if that’s not
possible for example the leg isn’t prepped or or the expertise that is
not available to ~~uh ~~to harvest the deep vein ~~Uh ~~then I
think using a small segment of rifampin soaked ~~uh ~~Dacron graft
~~uh ~~would be probably what I would use ~~Um ~~and you know
you get some rifampin from the pharmacy you get a probably a six or
eight millimeter Diameter a segment of Dacron and that’s your inner
position graph as far as tunneling it that and and and how to route it
That sort of depends upon the injury ~~Um ~~obviously the ~~
~~the the proximal most segments of The [00:40:00] SMA are you know
right underneath the pancreas ~~Um ~~if if this involves for example
a Whipple procedure where the head of the pancreas has got to come out
and and and with that approximal portion of the SMA ~~ ~~then ~~um
~~you know then then that’s probably gonna require a six or eight
millimeter diameter ~~uh ~~interposition graft you know to replace
that And ~~uh ~~And ~~uh uh ~~if it’s more distal ~~uh ~~and
the SMA and now it’s ~~uh ~~you know in the infra means a colic The
transverse colon is off and you’re and they end up in the injury or the
the segment is is for example ~~um ~~below ~~um ~~the the the
transverse colon and that’s going to be you know three or four
millimeters and it may be there that vein ~~uh ~~you know sadness
pain would would work or in some of those cases a patch angioplasty
using vein ~~Uh ~~is actually</p>
<p>easier and better than than trying to do an interposition graft to sort
of debris the the injury and then and then do a patch angioplasty using
a segment of a saphenous vein</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong> All right One follow up question ~~Um ~~in these
situations with SMA [00:41:00] injuries so you were a parent and the
bowel doesn’t look infarcted or threatened at the time Do you think it’s
mandatory to leave these patients open and do a second look even if
everything is fine on the first time ~~Um ~~do you think you can
kind of take it on a case by case basis</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Yeah I think and I think you’re getting at a a an
important point here which is one we’ve emphasized throughout our
discussion is that none of these ~~uh ~~these procedures these these
techniques that we’re describing take place in isolation right They they
they have to be in conjunction with anesthesia and an assessment of the
patient’s physiology And And the whole team including the intensive care
unit team et cetera So it’s a really good point ~~Um ~~My own
preference in these situations is to leave the leave the abdomen open
with a temporary abdominal closure of some sort and plan a look ~~Um
~~you know 24 to 36 hours later I I really That I think ~~um ~~it
~~uh ~~I think we know that the morbidity ~~uh ~~of [00:42:00]
of that approach ~~uh ~~is is very low I suspect ~~um ~~you know
~~um ~~I think it probably provides ~~uh ~~not just reassurance
but probably some real advantages in case ~~Uh ~~the the the
perfusion actually ~~uh ~~is not adequate and the patient becomes
~~uh ~~acidemic and the bowel is compromised you know subsequent to
~~uh ~~To a pure initial departure from the or</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Great And just to breeze through the inferior mesenteric
artery ~~Uh ~~would you agree that you can ~~uh ~~generally like
gate this with impunity if it’s damaged in a trauma</p>
<p>situation</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> ~~Um ~~I think ~~um uh ~~never say ~~uh
~~like eight with impunity ~~Um ~~but I ~~uh ~~because ~~uh
~~there’s always situations where ~~um ~~You know I think it has
to be thoughtful a ligation and in this case yes I think the majority of
times the the inferior mesenteric artery can be ligated ~~Um ~~I
think the thoughtful approach here is to make an assessment as of to the
patency of the iliac vessels and specifically the internal iliac vessels
I think if ~~um uh ~~What we’re [00:43:00] describing which is
ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery one can be more assured that
that’s going to be tolerated if both internal iliac arteries are patent
for example ~~Um ~~if the SMA is paid and the celiac is paid and
then then the inferior mesenteric artery is almost always tolerated
~~Um ~~if for some If it’s an aged person who’s got occluded
internal iliacs or they’ve got atherosclerosis lucid disease and their
mesenteries are not good then I think you have to be a little worried
about ligating the Ima in some cases</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Right And just for ~~uh ~~residents that’ll be rounding I
think we generally discuss when talking about the Ima and you know open
aorta situations if it’s occluded Or it’s pulsatile then we feel
comfortable like eating it It’s when it has that kind of a slight ~~uh
~~dribble back that we may consider re implanting it ~~Um ~~just
to kind of prepare you for your rounds ~~Um ~~dr SPC and we’re going
to jump into the last vessel ~~uh ~~of branches [00:44:00] of the
aorta Not an easy one to discuss either ~~Uh ~~we’re going to get
the renal arteries ~~Um ~~and ~~um ~~You know I I know it
differs kind of whether it’s proximal or distal it very much as far as
your exposure ~~Um ~~but how how do you think of the renal arteries
in your management of them in a traumatic situations</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> think that it’s ~~um ~~I think that what I’m thinking
about in that question is ~~um ~~Is similar these other vessels that
that ~~um ~~and and hopefully it’s helpful as a broad principle and
an approach you know ~~um ~~we started this discussion talking about
exposure and making sure communicate with anesthesia and you know having
the right suction devices and retracting devices and headlights ~~uh
~~in these broad concepts to make sure that you you’ve thought about
~~um ~~going into these cases ~~Um ~~you know I think ~~um
~~when it comes to the renal arteries like like all these festivals
~~um ~~it’s useful to think well ~~uh ~~I’m either in a in a
fairly elective situation you know meaning I’ve got things under control
~~uh ~~for the moment Patient’s physiology is a [00:45:00] solid
~~um ~~you know there’s there’s whatever bleeding there is is
controlled and I I’ve got a reasonable exposure ~~uh ~~in contrast
to ~~um ~~I am in a uncontrolled situation and there’s the patients
~~uh uh ~~in a in a really bad situation ~~Um ~~you know the
bleeding is not controlled I don’t know where the bleeding is coming
from et cetera And I think because it helps one to ~~um ~~Have a
mindset about whether I’m pursuing damage control surgery you know am I
going to have to how how much am I going to work to maintain a patency
of this vessel or am I going to be more tolerant of litigating it and
just as a damage controlman over and having to deal with ~~Uh ~~the
consequences ~~uh ~~but recognizing I need to do it to say the
patient’s life So the renal arteries are like that I think because it is
similar to the SMA it is pretty unlikely in the setting of trauma to be
reconstructing a renal artery I think that’s pretty rare ~~uh ~~in
trauma that the kidney the renal artery is either ~~um ~~[00:46:00]
Not injured ~~um ~~you know not injured And you know there’s there’s
hematoma that is from the parenchyma of the kidney or surrounding
vessels ~~uh ~~or the renal artery is injured and Broncos you know
and and And if it’s certainly if it’s injured in thrombose by the time
you know an individual gets to it it’s probably too late The scheming
time or mosquito time to the kidney’s been too great and there’s not
going to be value of of ~~uh ~~of trying to reconstruct it in the
setting of trauma And so if it happens to be an in between and I say
well let’s say that a actually it is one of these cases where ~~uh
~~you know explore the The ~~uh ~~the zone two hematoma and a is
coming from a main renal artery ~~Um ~~then you know and there’s
flow in it but it’s bleeding Then I think the principles that we have
described ~~Uh ~~such as ~~uh ~~either primary repair ~~um uh
uh ~~four or five Oh ~~uh ~~potentially probably in this case
maybe a six O ~~uh ~~monofilament sutures such as proline It would
be useful if that appears to ~~uh ~~[00:47:00] compromise the lumen
and ~~um ~~either a patch angioplasty of that artery ~~Uh ~~or
you know a bypass But again that is extremely rare in the setting of
trauma ~~Um ~~you know if it’s going to require more than than a
primary repair ~~um ~~you know it’s I think in my experience equally
likely that ~~uh ~~you know you’re going to be ~~um ~~ligating
that vessel for damage control</p>
<p>~~Um Uh ~~but but it’s pretty rare to be doing a complex renal
artery repair in the setting of of trauma similar to the proximal SMA
injuries for example</p>
<p>It just pretty rare</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong> right Can you talk to us about your emotions You’re dealing
with your renal hematomas whether they’re Penetrating or blind I know
the old adage of every penetrating renal hematoma should be explored and
blood one should not be explored unless they’re expanding May not be
true but can you kind of walk us through how you approached this</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Right So you know zone two this would be a you know zone
one or the central ~~uh ~~dominal hematomas and you know the rules
that [00:48:00] you’re alluding to or that you know almost all or all
zone one hematomas should be ~~uh ~~explored ~~um ~~Zone two
hematomas which are the kidneys in the lateral gutters ~~Uh uh
~~basically ~~um ~~you know <del>the the</del> the general rule is that
if it’s a ~~uh ~~expanding hematoma regardless if the mechanism is
blunt or penetrating then those hematomas Should be explored in zone two
~~Um ~~the general rule goes as most of your listeners know if it’s
a blunt injury ~~uh ~~and the zone two hematoma is not expanding
then that does not need to be explored ~~Um ~~In contrast if it’s a
zone to hematoma from a penetrating mechanism then most of the time
though than need to be explored even if the hematomas is stable Those
are the general rules that <del>we</del> we use to guide our approach to <del>zone
two a retroperitoneal or</del> zone to retroparotoneil hematoma So I use
those I think that’s ~~uh ~~those are pretty good ~~Um ~~You
know I ~~uh ~~I think there are times [00:49:00] when ~~uh ~~a
blunt ~~Uh ~~you know one finds themselves in in in in the belly
because there was a hemoperitoneum from a another injury And ~~and uh
and and ~~there is a blunt mechanism and there’s a zone two hematoma I
have explored those in the past And I think that if ~~uh ~~I don’t
think those guidelines are meant to be You know a dictums that can never
be ~~um ~~adjusted ~~uh <del>for an individual case</del> I’m not sure if
that ~~</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> So ~~uh ~~one question ~~Uh ~~I know a lot of times
many of these cases we don’t already have the laparotomy performed
~~Um ~~you know they’re in the trauma Bay They get a CT scan and
they they call and say there’s an intimal flap There’s a fistula maybe a
pseudo aneurysm and the renal artery ~~Um uh ~~any kind of general
principles for</p>
<p>some of these sort of</p>
<p>incidental findings</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> <del>and I think that’s a that’s probably a</del> so what you
described there is is the most obviously I guess the most common
scenario in which ~~which uh <del>which it’s a</del> uh~~ The CT finding
you know right in or just after the resuscitation room <del>of a of a</del> of
a main [00:50:00] renal artery injury ~~uh ~~branch renal artery
injury or maybe ~~uh ~~you know <del>uh</del> parenchymal injury to the
kidney <del>Um</del> and in those cases <del>um</del> I think if the <del>uh</del> let’s say
it’s the intimal flap that you described If the intimal flap is <del>uh</del>
Either not Mateen and there’s perfusion in the kid on that CT scan for
example ~~Um ~~and it does not appear to be flow limiting then that
can be observed ~~Uh ~~some of those like other blond arterial
injury some of those will heal ~~Um ~~if it is amenable to an
endovascular placement of a bare metal stent ~~uh ~~that Can be used
in some institutions to tack down ~~um ~~or stabilize that detection
~~Um ~~and that will be if if if you really feel like it is a flow
limiting more than 50% stenosis ~~uh ~~caused by that intimal flap
the more distal branch artery injuries can often also be managed with
endovascular techniques such as [00:51:00] coil embolization Replacement
of an ~~uh ~~occlusive ~~uh ~~you know hemostat coil or other
device ~~Um ~~and I think coil embolizing or or or treating those
depends upon ~~um ~~you know how the patient is doing how much blood
they’re requiring how large the hematoma is ~~Um ~~and then what
their hemodynamics are ~~Um ~~but I think for those reasons ~~uh
uh ~~what we described ~~uh ~~five or 10 minutes ago ~~um
~~having to fix these main <del>these</del> these renal artery injuries in
the ORs pretty uncommon because they’ve either been diagnosed and
managed ~~um ~~based off CT with or without endo Endovascular
technologies and oftentimes the management of a renal artery injury If
you’re in the or ~~uh ~~exploring and expanding you know hematoma
and one of the zone twos is is going to be nephrectomy you know ~~uh
~~because it’s it’s that major injury in which there’s just not ~~uh
~~there’s not the ~~uh ~~[00:52:00] indication for</p>
<p>repair</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong> <del>all the ranches of the aorta from the diaphragm Down to the
renals and Ima And</del> I want to thank you very very much for taking a
complex topic and it’s sort of convoluted in breaking it down from
technical steps to ~~uh ~~algorithms for exposure to how to repair I
think this was overall an excellent episode Well we haven’t touched on
the endovascular management of trauma which we’ll save for another
episode ~~Um ~~but thank you so much for for a great discussion I
for recipes</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> well I applaud you for tackling this ~~ ~~topic is
~~uh ~~unruly you know ~~it uh uh ~~both in the the anatomy
~~uh uh <del>the anatomic</del> ~~exposure ~~uh <del>operative exposure and
then the seemingly endless number of scenarios</del> Um <del>That can be
considered for either observation repair or damage control ligation I
mean it’s a it’s a it’s a complex topic</del> I~~ would ~~uh <del>commend
you for tackling it and I hope that our discussion is is useful</del>
for~~ for you <del>and uh</del></p>
<p>and your listeners</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> [00:53:00] Definitely I think this gives people the the
groundwork to really make some safe decisions ~~Um ~~one thing I
want to mention to our listeners if you click on our show notes or you
go to audible bleeding.com we’re going to have links to different
YouTube videos that will have ~~uh ~~breakdowns of many of these
exposures so you can listen to this and then go watch it later to really
reinforce it ~~Um ~~so thank you dr recipe set again for an
extremely complex episode that you’re breaking down onto a podcast</p>
<p>Thank you for listening to audible bleeding. This is part two of six of
our vascular trauma series with dr mucin. Be sure to tune in to hear the
rest of the series. Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> [00:00:00] welcome back to another collaboration between
behind the knife and audible bleeding Today we’re going to be covering
vascular trauma <del>with uh our host Dr. Todd Rasmussen I’m sorry</del> with
our guest Dr. Todd Rasmussen Dr. Rasmussen is a Colonel the United
States air force and professor of surgery and Associate Dean of research
at the uniform services university of health sciences and an attending
vascular surgeon at Walter Reed national military medical center A
couple of weeks ago he helped us out with the peripheral vascular trauma
and today he’s going to take us through abdominal vascular trauma ~~Uh
~~thank you dr recipes for joining us again on this collaborative
podcast</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> You bet Thank you for the opportunity and the
congratulations to you and your team on creating such a useful
information sharing venue So I’m pleased to be with you[00:01:00]</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> <del>Absolutely Um and</del> we also have a ad hum A muesli on the
podcast He’s a chief resident at Cornell and a one of the team members
of audible bleeding So welcome</p>
<p>Adam</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong> Yeah Thanks I’m excited to be here for this one</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> ~~Um ~~so for the sake of time we’re going to skip the
preoperative workup and description of anatomy and zones of abdominal
vascular trauma So please review this ~~uh kind of ~~on your own
~~Um ~~and just as a side note we’re also going to skip the
management of iliac artery injuries We covered that as part of our
peripheral vascular trauma talk It can fit into abdominal vascular
trauma but for the sake of time we’re going to just jump into a true
abdominal vascular trauma So we’re gonna start out with a little
scenario just to <del>kind of</del> get our feet wet here ~~Um ~~so doctor
asks me it’s in a you have a patient with a gunshot wound to the abdomen
~~A ~~general surgery has already prepped them from the neck to the
knees and performed a laparotomy from the xiphoid to the pubis They pack
the abdomen and temporarily have control ~~uh ~~on what they said
was pulsatile bleeding from zone one ~~Uh ~~can you take us through
~~uh ~~how to get ~~a ~~super celiac control And in a case like
this and in a trauma</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Sure ~~Um ~~so I think ~~uh ~~you know I think
for cases like this ~~uh uh ~~[00:02:00] just a couple of starter
points ~~um ~~you know no case like this ~~uh ~~Should proceed
without you know close communication with the entirety of the
resuscitation team So I think if I was coming into a case like this or
participated in a case like this with you know with our team ~~uh
~~I would start by making sure ~~um ~~that I was on good terms
with my anesthesia colleagues that they ~~Uh ~~knew what we were
~~um ~~facing ~~uh uh ~~in this ~~uh ~~in this situation
that they were pursuing all the key tenants of damage control
resuscitation and ~~uh uh ~~and and all that That means meaning
~~uh ~~you know leading with a blood product or whole blood
resuscitation keeping the patient warm ~~Uh ~~and and all of those
tenants So I would start with that ~~Um and I think as far as
technically um the ~~from a technical standpoint ~~um ~~in these
types of cases ~~uh ~~I will almost always ~~uh ~~you can’t so
what you can’t see and ~~uh ~~I’ll I’ll often ~~uh ~~really
immediately assess my exposure I mean meaning the laparotomy [00:03:00]
So you mentioned that ~~um ~~Laparotomy in this case was from the to
the pubis And and and that’s a great start But ~~um ~~but for the
approach that you have referenced is likely to be needed in this case
~~um ~~I’ll often reset and actually come up a higher go between the
and the costal margin and almost begin ~~uh ~~you know two to three
centimeters of ~~uh ~~Of a of a sternotomy It’s not a sternotomy but
it is at least coming along the SciFest side of the xiphoid and really
release ~~uh ~~thoracic the inferior costal margins of the thoracic
~~uh ~~under the diaphragm so that she can really pull the diaphragm
~~Uh ~~I mean sorry the cost of margins laterally and up so that you
want to suspend ~~Uh ~~your costal margins ~~uh ~~so that you’re
almost suspending the patient’s ~~uh ~~rib cage up in a way from the
aorta and the abdominal contents So I think making a good assessment of
your exposure initially really important Hopefully ~~um ~~you know
[00:04:00] in in in the case ~~uh ~~that I am prepping and in an
operate on these cases I’ll try as best I can to use a retractor Such as
the ~~um ~~that will allow for retractors to really be placed up
underneath the costal margin So again you can spread spread those costs
origins and try to lift the thoracic ~~uh ~~almost lift the cost of
margins away from the abdominal contents If if you don’t have an Omni
you can still make sure that you’re trying to ~~OSE and ~~suspend
that ~~um um superior most aspect or cuddle Or ~~cranium aspect of
your ~~um ~~of your exposure Once that’s done And the other part of
communicating with anesthesia is to see if they have a nasal gastric
tube down ~~Um ~~super celiac ~~um ~~control of or in this case
is almost always facilitated by ~~um ~~having a nasal gastric tube
in the esophagus to allow one to ~~two You know to ~~pop esophagus
~~um um ~~in this area ~~uh ~~and and then be able to get around
that esophagus circumferentially and sometimes place ~~uh uh ~~some
sort of [00:05:00] umbilical tape or sometimes a Penrose drain to allow
for apt ~~uh ~~left sided Retraction of the esophagus away from the
~~uh the uh ~~a cruise that’s surrounding the aorta The other areas
is really mobilizing the left lateral segment of the liver ~~Um ~~so
that that can either be brought cephalad or tucked ~~uh ~~you know
once it’s mobilized can be ~~uh ~~Tucked in in area early and
brought to the right side or the whole portion of the liver so that
you’ve got the left lateral segment out of the way And now at this point
you know one is left with ~~um Uh ~~the cruise that’s overlying the
aorta The other maneuver here sometimes dependent upon the situation is
is put into patient a little bit of reverse Trendelenburg to let the
stomach and and pull that stomach the inferiorally so that you create as
big a window as you can Oh with the esophagus retracted to the patient’s
left ~~uh ~~the stomach kind of pulled down Sometimes you can have a
resident or a an assistant put their hand on the [00:06:00] stomach and
retract it towards the pelvis if you will Sometimes a little bit of
reverse T-Bird helps with that and you can kind of hopefully picture
this So now you’ve got the separated ~~Uh ~~you’ve really The cost
of margin suspended and now you’ve got a window in which you can work
And ~~uh ~~and at this point now it’s ~~uh ~~maneuvers dividing
the skeletal muscle which is the cruise overline the aorta This can
often facilitated with a large right ankle ~~um ~~you know in a
Bovie extender ~~Um ~~and you know in this case ~~um Uh ~~you
know you can almost always see ~~uh ~~that you’re dividing skeletal
muscle over the aorta ~~Uh ~~if there’s a pulse hopefully there’s
even a weak pulse ~~Uh ~~you know one can feel the aorta and just
divide the cruise over the aorta and and try to do some blood dissection
on either side to allow your patient of the spine ~~Um ~~On either
side ~~Uh ~~you know in these cases I typically don’t try to spend
time getting circumferential control of the aorta It’s not like an
elective aneurysm <del>control So or elect bang chrism</del> [00:07:00] repair
where we’ll sometimes get round the entire order and these cases if you
can get on their side of the aorta down fine ~~Um ~~you know that
that is is is what is needed ~~uh and uh ~~and is most efficient in
these emergent sort of cases So up there if you have other questions I
mean it’s a it’s a unexposed which requires you know a comprehensive set
of of ~~uh ~~of things to think about But I’ll I’ll</p>
<p>stop there for now</p>
<p>Do you have any</p>
<p>questions or comments</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong> So~~ um ~~my question is sometimes you’re faced with a
situation of entering a patient sad them and obviously there’s a large
rush of blood and you think it may be coming from somewhere in the upper
aorta Do you think it’s worth taking the time to get super Celia and
control in the in the way that you described before doing a video this
rotation and exposing the order that way Or are there any scenarios in
which you should do a medial visceral rotation first before you do that
So take us through can you take us through a [00:08:00] medial visceral
rotation When did she to want to leave the kidney down when to take it
off sort of the falls and advantages of doing each of those approaches</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Yeah I think so That’s a great question I think It is
worth getting super celiac control If in the scenario that you described
where where you you know the description is a zone one a hematoma that’s
bleeding ~~um ~~and ~~um ~~you know you you’ve got some a little
bit of time you know somebody may be holding pressure or ~~uh ~~but
I do think it’s worth getting super celiac control if you think it’s
from the zone one Now if it’s ~~Uh ~~you know the initial
description was on one and then you get in there and you look and it’s
actually it looks to be from the spleen or or from a different area then
then you can readjust But if it’s truly a a a zone one hematoma that’s
got active bleeding ~~uh ~~then I to answer your question I do think
it’s worth taking the time to get super celiac control ~~Um ~~the
medial visceral rotation of courses [00:09:00] is designed to to ~~uh
~~to to give up ~~Um ~~you know optimal exposure to the left
medial visceral rotation is is designed to give optimal exposure of of
the para visceral segment of the aorta So ~~um ~~that is you know
the the the super celiac segment all the way down to ~~uh ~~You know
to the aortic bifurcation and and ~~uh ~~and and really the left
primarily the left iliac common iliac artery ~~uh ~~initially
although it can be taken across the ORIC bifurcation to see the right
iliac as well ~~uh ~~in this case that that is ~~uh ~~performed
through dividing ~~uh ~~the white line of told ~~uh ~~along the
sigmoid sigmoid colon and the left colon ~~Um ~~and ~~uh ~~you
know establishing this plane and the retroperitonium ~~Um ~~and and
a good portion of this is is steady ~~um ~~you know blunt dissection
~~Uh ~~it’s facilitated with Bovie electrocautery But it it is also
~~um ~~you know there’s a plane in that ~~uh ~~in this area that
is developed <del>with uh with</del> with blood [00:10:00] to section as well
And in the setting of trauma ~~um ~~almost always <del>uh this</del> this
detection plane is taken from the sigmoid the left colon up to divide
the the attachments ~~uh ~~and grained the spleen ~~Uh ~~and and
the left kidney all the way ~~uh ~~to the to the midline and then to
the patient’s right ~~Uh ~~ultimately ~~um ~~and I think in in
the setting of trauma the kidney is Almost always ~~uh uh ~~brought
up ~~uh ~~into this and and and just bring the kidney up I think
it’s generally easier It’s a little bit faster because you don’t have to
take the time to to find that plane ~~uh ~~you know above the left
kidney and ~~uh ~~to leave it down in the setting of trauma ~~Um
~~I would almost always bring that left kidney up</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> ~~Okay ~~</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> ~~if that’s uh yeah ~~</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> ~~Yeah I think that’s perfect Uh one question I have is it
seems like the spleen is always uh getting in the way and always
bleeding at the end of one of these rotations Do you have any tips for
managing uh bleeding from the spleen ~~</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> ~~Well I think this um goes back to I think uh uh my
initial comments and and probably one of the key tenants of of this type
of a procedure is exposure and making sure that if you’re going to
undertake this that you’ve really Gotcha Retractor you’ve got your
incision up along the alongside not just to the XY FOI but along side
the XY Floyd and the cost of margin so that you can really bring that
the left cost of margin both of them and suspend it up Because I think
and in many cases what you described is a result of just not being able
to see well Um and so um you know I think the the best I would the best
tip I could give is is to really try to make sure that uh that your
exposure is as best you can and if you’re compromising on exposure um
you know um which which is easier said than done I I understand that But
uh if you feel like you’re compromising on exposure or retraction um uh
that is uh that that’s uh I think a contributor ~~</p>
<p>~~to to ~~</p>
<p>~~to splenic ~~</p>
<p>~~injury ~~</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong> I have a question Speaking of exposure specifically about
eviscerating the battle I find myself as the as the senior residents
sometimes appreciating actually having difficult and nuances to do this
The way that I’ve learned to do it is kind of taking all the bowel and
finding a lap pad large [00:11:00] enough that’s moist I’m placing some
sort of clamp or something around it and then having someone hold it
outside the abdomen but I’ve always found that it sort of ends up being
clunky or the bowel falls out of the time Do you have any tips on how to
eviscerate and control the small balance situation like this</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> That’s a great question And it is ~~uh ~~it’s it is
very difficult to describe this ~~uh ~~using ~~uh ~~in a
discussion It’s one of those things where you just got to feel it But in
my experience this is the and I hope those who are listening and you can
kind of picture yourself in the situation This is really the the the the
main Purview and job of the surgeon that’s on the patients right So you
can picture in a you’re on the patient’s rights and and it takes a it
takes a ~~um ~~it takes a strong and and I think big ~~uh ~~I
don’t necessarily mean physical but ~~uh ~~it takes a strong and a
big right hand to get that bowel ~~um ~~that ~~um ~~you know
Often and over [00:12:00] and to the patient’s right side you’re you
know you’re pulling it from the left to the right And and I you know I’m
sitting here to describing it and my hand is I’m trying to extend my
hand as wide as I can you know and and it’s ~~uh ~~it’s not a subtle
move It’s not ~~um ~~it it shouldn’t be a rugged but it needs to be
very ~~uh ~~it can’t be done with a gentle ~~uh ~~it’s Until a
type of thing you’ve gotta be strong with it And I don’t use in this
situation I’ll get ~~uh uh ~~operative towels I’ll ask them to
moisten blue towel ~~uh ~~or wet blue towel And you know basically
what you do is with you know with your left hand as you take that blue
towel and you put it underneath your right hand which has the viscera in
it and you know you sort of You tried to get it down at the base so that
you really that blue towel here and your right fingers are coming across
the aorta you know ~~um ~~cause you’re taking it from the you know
from the patient’s left to the patients to the midline and then
[00:13:00] try to get it over to the right and then put this big blue
towel this wide blue towel ~~Um ~~you know underneath your fingers
~~uh ~~and then you know lay it out and and ~~uh ~~then
hopefully I mean this is where I I actually like in my situation or in
my preferences to use the Omni ~~Uh ~~but you’re going to need big a
wide you know retractor ~~Uh ~~that’s going to take the place of
your right hand That’s going to now come in on the top of that blue
towel And ~~uh ~~and hold all of that and maybe a couple that hold
that visceral you know to the patient to the right of</p>
<p>the patient’s Midland</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong> That’s one of those maneuvers that I feel like is very much
easier said than them and I’ve been</p>
<p>humbled by it</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> it’s very difficult to describe</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong> ~~I want to just ask a follow up question about the middle
of the medial visceral rotation that I asked her My question just to
clarify question is is there ever a situation in which you’re faced with
a bleeding error where because of the time it takes to get super sealing
I control that you would rather do a visceral rotation and be controlled
being on it that way Or is your approach always Basically without fail
too if you have a high aortic injury to get your con control and then
immediately rotate the viscera and expose the order that way Secondly
~~</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> ~~Well I think there’s um great question I mean I think
that if you um there there are scenarios where if you if you If you feel
like uh you know you see the bleeding let’s say um you know it’s zone
one and all of a sudden you you know you’re getting ready to do this and
you see that it is a spurter from the SMA you know a superior mesenteric
artery and it doesn’t look like it’s the aorta for example And because
there’s some structures of course in zone one that aren’t I mean
obviously they’re not some are not the aorta So uh I think that the
scenario that you would Um forego super celiac control uh would be a
scenario in which you you made an observation that you felt like you saw
the bleeding It wasn’t necessarily from the aorta and you felt like you
could kind of get it controlled Locally you know without having to
occlude a inflow from the aorta So but that um if it’s unknown you know
and you have the you had just uh you don’t know where it’s coming from
in zone one I think short of that I would um advocate for trying to get
a super celiac control ~~</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Great ~~Um ~~so when we talked to the left medial this
rotation for our kind of med students out there we’re we’re thinking
that there’s likely an aortic injury or a a a branch close off the aorta
~~Um ~~sometimes you’ll need to do a right medial visceral rotation
though ~~Um ~~and that’s generally when you’re kind of worried about
either ~~um ~~generally a [00:14:00] IVC injury ~~Um ~~so Dr
said can you just take us through a few of the nuances of a right medial
Chris rotation</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Right So this is ~~um ~~you know this from obviously
from the other side and this involves dividing the the White line of
toll ~~um ~~starting often at the and the coming along the right
colon and bringing the ~~um ~~you know the Sikh ~~uh ~~cephalad
and and ~~uh ~~and the entire right colon ~~uh ~~you know to the
patient’s left now and then cephalad it’s I’m surprised ~~uh ~~most
of the time in these cases it’s actually Not so much a ~~uh
~~rotation to the mid line and then the left as it is ~~uh
~~bringing everything up cephalad to almost to the patient’s left
costal margin for example They really are almost bringing the CQM and
the and the right colon ~~Um ~~You know to the up onto the patient’s
left chest in a way ~~Um uh ~~and and this is a plane that also
similar to the medial visceral rotation ~~uh ~~on the left
[00:15:00] side This is a plane that is largely developed ~~uh
~~with blunt ~~uh ~~dissection It’s a combination Once the the The
parent Niamh retroperitoneum has been opened with with ~~uh ~~some
Bovie electrocautery ~~uh ~~than than the plane should develop And
in this case ~~uh ~~you’ll see almost immediately the the left iliac
vein ~~uh ~~and then the vena cava And ~~uh ~~and you continue
to bring ~~um uh ~~the the left colon up until you see the the left
renal vein or I’m sorry the right renal vein and ~~uh ~~and the
kidney And ~~um ~~And and you know it did it’s superior extent This
will ~~um ~~of course ~~uh ~~expose the head of the pancreas the
duodenum and the head of the pancreas And ~~um ~~similarly ~~um
~~You know this the visitor in this situation I get a ~~uh ~~a wet
blue towel or operating towel I guess it can be white towel but I don’t
really like to use a lap sponge cause it’s too small and it doesn’t
quite have enough substance And you will one will ~~um ~~you know
place that that [00:16:00] Blue operative towel down along your fingers
that are bringing this this all of the vis are up so that you really get
it all partitioned away with with a substantive ~~uh uh ~~operative
towel ~~Um ~~and that that has to be then you know cold in ~~uh
~~with a large retractors so that your hands are free to actually
operate</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Perfect ~~Uh ~~one thing I just want to remind some of
our residents in medicines out there is I I would really go onto YouTube
after this and just look up ~~uh ~~left and right middle vis
rotation that’ll really help solidify these points It’s one thing
hearing it but I think if you watch some videos on it I think it’ll
really help bring it all together ~~Um and if you also want to ~~</p>
<p>~~hear ~~</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Yeah I think I was going to say the same or to obviously
have an Atlas but are you know something because it’s it is you got to
kind of combine I think ~~uh ~~the word ~~uh ~~that we’re
talking about here with with some sort of visual aid the end the thing
that I would recommend and make a point ~~um uh ~~is for those who
have the opportunity to assist with spine exposures So ~~uh ~~in
these maneuvers that [00:17:00] we often perform as ~~uh ~~assisting
our orthopedic or neuro surgical colleagues to ~~uh ~~expose ~~uh
~~do anterior exposure to the spine ~~Uh ~~many of these maneuvers
we’re talking about are performed in the spine exposure which which
sometimes can be overlooked by trainees And and and even They sometimes
is well that’s not a very good operation You don’t really get to ~~uh
~~so and and it’s not really a basket operation Boy I’ll tell ya
~~Um ~~high exposures are a great way to begin to ~~uh ~~nerve
or learn the tenants of of of rotating the visceral ~~uh ~~either to
the right to the left and exposing the retroperitonium</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong> I think also ~~um ~~procurements have been extremely
helpful for liver and kidney ~~Um ~~this right sided rotation Is it
usually the first step of any procurement And then you’re kind of seeing
the entire intro part IOM So it’s also a very good opportunity to learn
some anatomy</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> ~~Absolutely And uh ~~</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Great point</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong> ~~Um ~~we haven’t discussed the ~~uh ~~infer renal
aorta yet [00:18:00] I think probably a slightly more straightforward
approach but can you discuss your technique for inferiority exposure and
then talk about I’m kind of coming across the renal vein when you can
like gate it how to get it out of the way things like that</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Right So the the most ~~um ~~You know the most common
and maybe most straightforward exposure is what we refer to as a you
know transperitoneal and from he’s a colleague ~~um ~~exposure of
the ~~um ~~the infer renal aorta ~~Uh ~~you know this here again
people ~~uh ~~who are listening and looking ~~um uh ~~either at
a videos or or ~~um ~~or an Atlas kind of recommend or recognize
that ~~uh uh ~~the infer music colleague ~~Um ~~means that the
transverse colon is ~~um ~~reflected cephalad and ~~um ~~it’s
one of the first moves is to really hold up the transverse colon ~~um
~~in the patient’s abdomen and and drape it up You know cephalad
almost on the patient’s costal margin And often ~~uh ~~you
[00:19:00] know I’ll set initially set a retractor Now that also goes
into a big to me is is partitioned with a ~~uh ~~operative towel a
moistened or wet operative towel to get the transverse colon ~~um
~~and retracted cephalad ~~Uh ~~and then the next move is to
divide the ligament of Treitz ~~Um ~~and this to me is always also a
maneuver that’s led by the surgeon on the patient’s right ~~Um
~~whether that’s the primary surgeon and the ~~uh ~~the attending
or resident ~~uh ~~however you’re configured this this maneuver
~~uh ~~dividing the ligament of Treitz and and getting the you know
fourth portion of the denim which is to the left of the midline in a
dividing that ligament of Treitz that peritoneum and and and bringing
that over to the patient’s right ~~uh ~~is is the next move ~~Um
~~and and that begins this ~~uh ~~Process of you know getting
really the the bowel Now ~~um ~~in this case the the left colon is
left ~~uh ~~remains to the patient’s left [00:20:00] but you’re
bringing all all bowel to the patient’s right ~~Um ~~this this is
not a medial visceral rotation of of the entirety of the viscera This is
only bringing the duodenum the fourth portion of the Dudina and all of
the small bowel Partitioning it to the patients Right And and this also
again if one can visualize this be done by the patient the surgeon to
the patient’s right and the right side of the patient bringing that
small bowel all the way across This also takes a wide and broad and
strong hand This can’t be done with ~~uh uh ~~I don’t know how else
to say it It’s just a broad and strong sort of ~~Uh ~~maneuver with
with the hand to bring this across and then and then partition get
another wet blue towel I keep saying blue I guess it could be white but
operative towel and Yeah Put that towel over your fingers And you know
as you bring the small bowel over that’s the ~~uh ~~infer renal
aorta ~~Um ~~you know this [00:21:00] positioning Then retractors
one will you know at the most cephalad extent of that ~~uh
~~exposure begin to see the left renal vein ~~Um ~~at the at the
root of the of the colon mesentery ~~Um ~~and ~~uh ~~you know at
the at the caudal most portion of this you’ll see the aortic bifurcation
~~Um ~~and ~~um ~~you know that’s that’s sort of the extent of
this The ~~um ~~the ~~uh ~~the the left renal vein Mmm Hmm Can
be like ~~uh ~~if if it if it facilitates aorta control ~~Um
~~obviously if one is going to locate the left renal vein it’s it’s
optimal to leave the ~~um ~~the branches of the left renal vein So
the gonadal eh the ~~uh ~~the lumbar vein which also often will
drain the left kidney and then the the ~~uh ~~the gonadal So if
those are left intact dividing that left renal vein ~~Uh ~~can
usually be accomplished without causing a significant detriment to the
left kidney ~~Um ~~I will say that dividing the left renal vein is
easier said than [00:22:00] done I mean it’s it is ~~uh ~~you know
it’s a thin wall structure which of course ~~uh ~~can bleed
significantly itself So you know these are all Sort of ~~uh
~~decisions that have to be made depending upon what what Andrew
you’re dealing with and and the extent of your exposure</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong> ~~Um ~~I think one question I forgot to ask you earlier
was I think Infor renally they are it is a little bit easier to get
around completely input you know an umbilical tamper a vessel loop
around But like you mentioned earlier Super celiac area That’s a lot
harder to do when sometimes the goal is not to always do that but you
have tips on how to do that Because again I’d been humbled by that I’m
in a procurement one time when the attending allowed me to try and get
around it and I tried to bluntly with my fingers to get around the
posterior Huerta and had a lot of trouble So do you have any tips about
that</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Well I think this is ~~um ~~I mean this is just takes
~~um ~~you know experience and and ~~uh ~~and And ~~uh ~~and
and time I mean I in my own mind as I see this I I ~~uh ~~you know
[00:23:00] this is a combination of ~~uh uh ~~sort of ~~uh ~~a
little bit of Metzenbaum scissors a little bit of kind of pushing ~~uh
~~you know cause what you’re trying to do is to to to to free the
aorta from from the connective tissue around it to get back to the spine
You know ~~uh ~~sometimes ~~uh ~~actually almost always I’ll use
a metallic Pediatric yang cower That is sort of one of my the suction or
dissection tools of choice is is <del>pediatric</del> Yankauer which is small
and profile It’s got a blunt tip It will you know it is a suction device
And so that’s useful ~~Um ~~and you know kind of this combination of
pushing ~~Uh ~~a little bit of maths here and there Metzenbaum
scissors ~~Um ~~and and a little bit of feeling with your finger so
you can get that connective tissue aorta freed ~~Uh ~~and then you
know you can begin one can begin to ~~um ~~to ~~uh ~~you know
use a right angle a big right angle and ~~uh ~~and ~~uh ~~try
<del>to uh to uh you know</del> to get underneath it Obviously what you’re
looking for here in [00:24:00] part is ~~uh ~~is a Is lumbar you
know you’re looking for the lumbar vessels which you know those are the
things you need to leave behind for at least by as we tell our residents
you know find the outside before you find the inside ~~Uh ~~you can
find them outside before you find the inside of a lumbar Then you can
clip it ~~Um ~~you know ~~uh ~~another I think very useful tool
in this situation is is having large Weck cliffs you know ~~uh
~~because you’re not it’s very difficult to pass you know a silk
~~uh ~~to lie gate a lumbar And in these situations a lot of times
you know you need those large WEC medium to large Weck clips ~~uh
~~to ~~uh ~~help you know get on either side of a of a lumbar
artery or vein</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> ~~Great Uh ~~one quick point back to their renal vein I
kind of picked this up just as fast past week is you can really get a
lot of mobilization on the renal vein just by ligating some of the
smaller branches ~~um ~~out distantly on it not even the gonadal but
sometimes the adrenal vein and a few of those veins And you can really
get ~~uh ~~you know five centimeters a [00:25:00] mobilization of
that renal vein which should give you enough distance to clamp ~~Um
~~But now we’re going to go into ~~um ~~each vessel off the aorta
I know this isn’t exactly what you’re going to see in a trauma You don’t
have isolated celiac artery injury or isolated SMA injury but just for
the sake of learning we’re going to talk through each vessel and talk
about the options of exposing it and then repairing it So starting
approximately a Dr. Rasmussen ~~um ~~can you discuss ~~uh ~~what
the best ways to see the celiac artery are and ~~um ~~any options
for repairing it</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Yeah So the you know the celiac artery ~~um ~~I guess
the origin of the celiac artery ~~um ~~can be seen either through
the lesser SAC ~~Uh ~~this is again ~~um uh ~~through ~~uh
~~you know an an sort of a I guess an anterior approach ~~uh uh
~~through the stack ~~Um ~~and this is ~~uh ~~would likely be
~~uh ~~very similar to the exposure we talked about ~~uh ~~with
a super celiac aortic exposure where the cause retracted ~~uh ~~you
know caudally down towards the pelvis ~~Um ~~[00:26:00] and ~~um
~~You know that opening lesser sack and pulling the stomach down and
and sort of getting the pancreas to come down That will expose then the
the origin of the first centimeter to the celiac artery If the proximal
segment of the celiac artery is injured and bleeding then then the
repair options ~~um ~~you know I I think lend into the category of
any vascular know major vascular three If it can be prepared repaired
~~uh ~~primarily ~~uh ~~then you know using ~~uh uh Uh
~~four Oh five Oh proline future If it does a grazing wound and
repairing it primarily ~~uh ~~can be done then then that’s that’s
one option ~~Uh ~~if it’s a large ~~um ~~you know ~~uh uh
~~celiac artery injury that that cannot be repaired primarily and
there’s destruction of the wall Oftentimes you’re an individuals in a
dam Really a damage control situation there And repair is not so much
Your first a lot of thought You’re [00:27:00] really situation trying to
just control bleeding and save patient’s life And and so in those cases
you know ~~uh ~~controlling the celiac artery and even consider you
know ~~uh ~~ligating it may be necessary ~~Um ~~you know as a
damage control maneuver at least initially ~~Um ~~the other way to
see the origin of the celiac artery is still left medial visceral
rotation So the maneuver we described before ~~uh ~~will show the
entire we’ll expose the the para visceral segment of the aorta</p>
<p>~~um ~~to include the first centimeter to the celiac artery</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong> ~~Uh ~~so ~~uh ~~any keys to identifying the common
hepatic artery and again ~~um ~~thoughts on ligation strategies and
repairs</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Right So I think the ~~um uh ~~you know I think I
mean the common a paddock you’ll need to that will not be able to be
visualized through the left medial visceral rotation ~~uh ~~that the
common hepatic and getting out into ~~Uh ~~the [00:28:00] segments
there of of the of the the major branches of the celiac ~~uh ~~one
we’ll need then in that case to be coming from a you know a transparent
to Neal you know ~~uh ~~anterior approach with a lesser SAC And you
know di ~~uh ~~identifying the common a paddock ~~um ~~you know
is is ~~um ~~Mmm You know requires sort of a recognition of where
the celiac artery is You’re in the lesser SAC The stomach really has to
be Ah inferiorly This is again if you find yourself operating in this
space you know the <del>the the</del> costal margins as I said to begin really
have to be flared And almost suspended up ~~Um ~~so that you’ve
really opened this Sometimes reverse Trendelenburg is useful ~~Uh
~~getting a hand a resident or a med student’s hand to pull the
stomach down ~~um ~~and open up that that that space ~~Um um
~~it you know that that will then should expose then the you know the
the the second and third segments of the celiac and its major branches
to include the common [00:29:00] hepatic artery</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Great And so ~~uh ~~as far as like getting the common
hepatic artery how does the GDA play into this ~~And ~~by that I
mean the gastroduodenal artery</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> I mean you know the ~~uh ~~the the the GDA is as I
guess is most commonly the case is you know and and listeners know is
Really one of the first or the first branch of the common hepatic artery
and and really defines the junction between the common hepatic and
proper paddock arteries ~~Um ~~and I think ~~um ~~I mean ideally
~~um ~~The common hepatic should should not ideally you don’t want
to legging any of these arteries right So I think that we start with
that premise to say geez if we can get a repair done that’s going to be
our that’s going to be ~~um ~~option a ~~um ~~whether that’s the
common hepatic proper paddock or GDA ~~uh ~~just like any artery in
the body like 18 it may be required as it is a damage control maneuver
~~Uh ~~just to ~~uh ~~control hemorrhage ~~Uh ~~[00:30:00]
let the patient recover a little bit talk to anesthesia and sort of see
how things are going Make an assessment of of of the region distal to
where you’ve liked it So so this is just a basic tenant of ~~uh
~~like aiding any artery in a damage control situation ~~Uh ~~we
recognize no matter which artery rely gating ~~Uh ~~the consequences
~~uh ~~of that ligation or we need to assess those consequences and
then and then address them if we’re able if patients you know able to
~~um ~~to move to the next step So ~~um ~~obviously liking the
comment of paddock distal to the GDA likely to Render you know ~~uh
~~a significant portion of the of the duodenum the pancreas and and
then the liver is schemic ~~Um ~~and so you know if the light
station can occur proximal if the injury is proximal to the GDA ~~um
~~then you know that would and G and perfusion can be maintained into
the GDA then that’s that’s preferable[00:31:00] ~~Um ~~but if I was
in one of these situations or when I am And we find ourselves having to
like ate it or we like hated it We didn’t quite know cause we didn’t but
we had to you know I was bleeding and there was a clip when we had a
damage control over ~~Um ~~and now Jeannie or the common paddock or
the proper paddocks lie dated Now what I usually will talk to anesthesia
We’ll get the patient as resuscitate as we can We’ll get out the Doppler
we’ll make an assessment because you know dependent upon patients can
tolerate but depending on the resuscitation status ~~uh ~~collateral
~~uh ~~where your legation is ~~Um ~~you know they may be able
to tolerate having any one of those vessels legged If on the other hand
without your Doppler and ~~uh ~~you get the patient resuscitate as
possible and there’s clear aschemia then you’re going to be faced with
the decision whether or not we need a reconstruct ~~uh ~~the this
leg vessel shunted ~~um ~~or ~~uh ~~you know it may be situation
where you have to deal with the metabolic consequences and leave the
[00:32:00] leave at like eight There’s not one answer You know that I
think there’s a there’s not one answer that applies to all situations
It’s a I think it’s a learning and adhering to the principles of damage
control resuscitation and damage control surgery</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> ~~Absolutely Um so off the record dr real quick I think you
miss uh said the distal and proximal cause you can lie gate the uh you
can like it The common a paddock Proximal to the GDA because you’ll have
retrograde flow from the GDA into the proper hepatic Right Um could you
just say that sentence and uh one more time and then ~~</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> ~~Sure what I guess what I’m what I’m meant to say And
I don’t you know uh actually looking at a diagram so I can try to uh see
the so what I meant to say is that you can often lie gait the common
hepatic um uh proximal GDA keeping a retrograde filling into the GDA and
maintaining a viability of the Dudina and the pancreatic head ~~</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Perfect Thank you Okay And now let’s dive into the ~~Um
~~and this is you know very close in proximity to the celiac artery So
many of the options to visualize it will be the same but there’s some
unique differences A is with its relationship with the pancreas ~~Um
~~so briefly doctor asked me Jason ~~uh ~~what are our options to
see the SMA and ~~uh ~~and and do we kind of think of SMA kind of in
portions a little differently than ~~uh ~~some</p>
<p>other vessels</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Definitely So the ~~uh ~~the SMA ~~um ~~you know
the the the pathway really to see the first centimeter to the SMA
superior mesenteric artery is is through the left medial visceral
rotation which will which will show the entire pair visceral segment of
the order ~~uh ~~including [00:33:00] for centimeter two of the
superior mesenteric artery If ~~uh ~~If more exposure needs to be
~~um ~~you know if if one is trying to expose more distal segments
of the SFA then ~~Uh ~~one probably have to go back to the anterior
approach not the left mijo visceral rotation ~~uh ~~and go through
the approach And in this case then the the superior mesic Terrick artery
is of course closely related to the head of the pancreas And and ~~uh
~~and ~~uh ~~and and so in this situation that the head of the
pancreas ~~uh ~~Well it needs to be you know ~~um ~~divided or
you know the the SMA is closely adherent to the head of the pancreas in
this case distal of the segment of the superior mesenteric artery distal
to the pancreas is often now ~~uh ~~best seen in an infra And these
a call like approach And this ~~uh ~~this is the superior mesenteric
artery exits the second segment ~~uh ~~and its relation with the
[00:34:00] pancreas and comes out into the the root of the mesentery and
~~uh ~~into the ~~uh ~~into the ~~uh ~~the small bowel This
is where for example <del>Mmm Mmm</del> One with lift the transverse colon
cephalad as we described before ~~um ~~and and retract the small
bowel to the patient’s right and see the the the root of the SMA ~~Uh
~~below ~~uh ~~and and inferior to the to the transverse colon So
yes there there are these ~~uh ~~stink segments of the superior
mesenteric artery ~~Um ~~expose Each of those segments ~~um
~~has a little bit of a different ~~uh ~~anatomic approach And and
then ~~uh ~~and each of those segments has ~~um ~~you know I
think considerations that are important that relate to surrounding
structures you know whether that’s the obviously the pancreas ~~uh
~~the root of the transfers colon ~~um ~~</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> thank you for taking us through those complicated anatomy of
the SMA as it kind of traverses the abdomen ~~Um ~~you know in
[00:35:00] all of these vessels obviously we you know primary repair is
kind of our our our first option if possible And then many times you may
need to interposition graft ~~Um ~~Just you know I know this is a
question that is very case dependent is there a portion of the SMA that
you can lie gate and or is a is SMA just a no</p>
<p>ligation zone throughout</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Well that’s a great question And ~~um ~~I think
similar to other other large axial vessels or arteries ~~um ~~you
know the more distal segments is just going to be better tolerated than
like eating the you know the proximal proximal segments So ~~um
~~You know I would not say it’s a no ligation zone in its throughout
its entirety ~~Um ~~but I do think ~~um ~~you know that if
possible ~~um ~~efforts should be maintained or efforts should be
undertaken to maintain flow through the SMA through you know through
through its entirety ~~Um ~~and you know repairing the SMA
[00:36:00] just it depends upon the injury ~~Um ~~if it ~~uh
~~is a small grazing Wound Then ~~um uh ~~then you know perhaps a
primary repair can be undertaken with a ~~uh ~~FORO or a five O
proline suture ~~Um um ~~if it’s a more substantial wound ~~um
~~and and one can get it controlled ~~um ~~and and isolate it
~~uh ~~you know ~~uh ~~than than repair can be ~~Um
~~Undertaken with a patchy angioplasty or even an interposition graft
That’s pretty rare And because those wounds are just so mortal ~~um
~~it’s very different You know patients who have those sorts of ~~uh
~~axial injuries at the proximal portions of these message check
vessels typically don’t survive ~~Um um ~~And so you know it’s very
difficult I I can’t think of a time when I’ve necessarily been repairing
for trauma the proximal segment or two of of the SMA ~~Uh ~~it’s a
little bit different for an elective tumor resection atherosclerotic
occlusive disease and such But ~~uh ~~for trauma[00:37:00] ~~Um
~~you know it’s it’s ~~uh ~~it’s pretty uncommon to be ~~uh
~~doing extensive repair of of these SMA segments I don’t I don’t know
what your experience is or our thoughts are on that</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong> I certainly have had zero experience preparing SMA injuries
~~Um ~~but</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> ~~Yeah I think it’s just pretty uncommon ~~</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong> ~~Um ~~I know that ~~uh ~~like you said in her
position grafting is probably more theoretical than realistic in a
situation like this But can you talk about the technique for it Maybe it
may be useful for other types of situations but ~~uh ~~what what
what material are you using where you’re where you’re bringing the graph
from and how you tunnel it</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> I was just going to say I think you guys are exactly right
And and and Adam and I both experienced this is yeah many times we’re
not seeing traumas with these injuries but many times we’re getting
called by the surgical oncologist with a kind of <del>can’t</del> cancer injury
to these vessels And so I think when we’re discussing SMA we can kind of
keep it in the perspective of how do we replace it if we need to ~~Um
~~and in the situation where they need to do some larger sections So
with that in mind a doctor asked [00:38:00] can W can you tell us how
you would bypass it</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Yeah So I think that the ~~um ~~I think that in these
cases you know and as I said in a rare situation ~~uh ~~in the
setting of trauma if you’ve if you’ve or able ~~uh ~~to establish
proximal and distal control and side-branch control of this segment and
~~uh ~~then you know your options for reconstructing it ~~um
~~with an interposition graft ~~um ~~you know would would include
using a prosthetic like PTFE or Dacron ~~Uh ~~or an autologous
tissue like vein And here it it just it depends ~~uh ~~it depends on
how prepared you know you are with the with patient for example as a
patient prepped ~~uh ~~where ~~uh ~~the one could harvest either
the very proximal segment of greater saffron is Fein or or a segment of
deep femoral vein which which may ~~um ~~actually ~~um ~~You
know have a better size match to the proximal portions of the SMA ~~Um
~~and and if that’s the [00:39:00] case you know if there’s Interra
contamination either from a tumor resection or from an injury than it is
preferable of course to to use autologous ~~uh ~~conduit such as
deep vein deep femoral vein a small segment of deep femoral vein ~~uh
~~or if the if the saphenous at its proximal extent is It’s large
enough ~~uh ~~you can one can use that ~~Um ~~if that’s not
possible for example the leg isn’t prepped or or the expertise that is
not available to ~~uh ~~to harvest the deep vein ~~Uh ~~then I
think using a small segment of rifampin soaked ~~uh ~~Dacron graft
~~uh ~~would be probably what I would use ~~Um ~~and you know
you get some rifampin from the pharmacy you get a probably a six or
eight millimeter Diameter a segment of Dacron and that’s your inner
position graph as far as tunneling it that and and and how to route it
That sort of depends upon the injury ~~Um ~~obviously the ~~
~~the the proximal most segments of The [00:40:00] SMA are you know
right underneath the pancreas ~~Um ~~if if this involves for example
a Whipple procedure where the head of the pancreas has got to come out
and and and with that approximal portion of the SMA ~~ ~~then ~~um
~~you know then then that’s probably gonna require a six or eight
millimeter diameter ~~uh ~~interposition graft you know to replace
that And ~~uh ~~And ~~uh uh ~~if it’s more distal ~~uh ~~and
the SMA and now it’s ~~uh ~~you know in the infra means a colic The
transverse colon is off and you’re and they end up in the injury or the
the segment is is for example ~~um ~~below ~~um ~~the the the
transverse colon and that’s going to be you know three or four
millimeters and it may be there that vein ~~uh ~~you know sadness
pain would would work or in some of those cases a patch angioplasty
using vein ~~Uh ~~is actually</p>
<p>easier and better than than trying to do an interposition graft to sort
of debris the the injury and then and then do a patch angioplasty using
a segment of a saphenous vein</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong> All right One follow up question ~~Um ~~in these
situations with SMA [00:41:00] injuries so you were a parent and the
bowel doesn’t look infarcted or threatened at the time Do you think it’s
mandatory to leave these patients open and do a second look even if
everything is fine on the first time ~~Um ~~do you think you can
kind of take it on a case by case basis</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Yeah I think and I think you’re getting at a a an
important point here which is one we’ve emphasized throughout our
discussion is that none of these ~~uh ~~these procedures these these
techniques that we’re describing take place in isolation right They they
they have to be in conjunction with anesthesia and an assessment of the
patient’s physiology And And the whole team including the intensive care
unit team et cetera So it’s a really good point ~~Um ~~My own
preference in these situations is to leave the leave the abdomen open
with a temporary abdominal closure of some sort and plan a look ~~Um
~~you know 24 to 36 hours later I I really That I think ~~um ~~it
~~uh ~~I think we know that the morbidity ~~uh ~~of [00:42:00]
of that approach ~~uh ~~is is very low I suspect ~~um ~~you know
~~um ~~I think it probably provides ~~uh ~~not just reassurance
but probably some real advantages in case ~~Uh ~~the the the
perfusion actually ~~uh ~~is not adequate and the patient becomes
~~uh ~~acidemic and the bowel is compromised you know subsequent to
~~uh ~~To a pure initial departure from the or</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Great And just to breeze through the inferior mesenteric
artery ~~Uh ~~would you agree that you can ~~uh ~~generally like
gate this with impunity if it’s damaged in a trauma</p>
<p>situation</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> ~~Um ~~I think ~~um uh ~~never say ~~uh
~~like eight with impunity ~~Um ~~but I ~~uh ~~because ~~uh
~~there’s always situations where ~~um ~~You know I think it has
to be thoughtful a ligation and in this case yes I think the majority of
times the the inferior mesenteric artery can be ligated ~~Um ~~I
think the thoughtful approach here is to make an assessment as of to the
patency of the iliac vessels and specifically the internal iliac vessels
I think if ~~um uh ~~What we’re [00:43:00] describing which is
ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery one can be more assured that
that’s going to be tolerated if both internal iliac arteries are patent
for example ~~Um ~~if the SMA is paid and the celiac is paid and
then then the inferior mesenteric artery is almost always tolerated
~~Um ~~if for some If it’s an aged person who’s got occluded
internal iliacs or they’ve got atherosclerosis lucid disease and their
mesenteries are not good then I think you have to be a little worried
about ligating the Ima in some cases</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> Right And just for ~~uh ~~residents that’ll be rounding I
think we generally discuss when talking about the Ima and you know open
aorta situations if it’s occluded Or it’s pulsatile then we feel
comfortable like eating it It’s when it has that kind of a slight ~~uh
~~dribble back that we may consider re implanting it ~~Um ~~just
to kind of prepare you for your rounds ~~Um ~~dr SPC and we’re going
to jump into the last vessel ~~uh ~~of branches [00:44:00] of the
aorta Not an easy one to discuss either ~~Uh ~~we’re going to get
the renal arteries ~~Um ~~and ~~um ~~You know I I know it
differs kind of whether it’s proximal or distal it very much as far as
your exposure ~~Um ~~but how how do you think of the renal arteries
in your management of them in a traumatic situations</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> think that it’s ~~um ~~I think that what I’m thinking
about in that question is ~~um ~~Is similar these other vessels that
that ~~um ~~and and hopefully it’s helpful as a broad principle and
an approach you know ~~um ~~we started this discussion talking about
exposure and making sure communicate with anesthesia and you know having
the right suction devices and retracting devices and headlights ~~uh
~~in these broad concepts to make sure that you you’ve thought about
~~um ~~going into these cases ~~Um ~~you know I think ~~um
~~when it comes to the renal arteries like like all these festivals
~~um ~~it’s useful to think well ~~uh ~~I’m either in a in a
fairly elective situation you know meaning I’ve got things under control
~~uh ~~for the moment Patient’s physiology is a [00:45:00] solid
~~um ~~you know there’s there’s whatever bleeding there is is
controlled and I I’ve got a reasonable exposure ~~uh ~~in contrast
to ~~um ~~I am in a uncontrolled situation and there’s the patients
~~uh uh ~~in a in a really bad situation ~~Um ~~you know the
bleeding is not controlled I don’t know where the bleeding is coming
from et cetera And I think because it helps one to ~~um ~~Have a
mindset about whether I’m pursuing damage control surgery you know am I
going to have to how how much am I going to work to maintain a patency
of this vessel or am I going to be more tolerant of litigating it and
just as a damage controlman over and having to deal with ~~Uh ~~the
consequences ~~uh ~~but recognizing I need to do it to say the
patient’s life So the renal arteries are like that I think because it is
similar to the SMA it is pretty unlikely in the setting of trauma to be
reconstructing a renal artery I think that’s pretty rare ~~uh ~~in
trauma that the kidney the renal artery is either ~~um ~~[00:46:00]
Not injured ~~um ~~you know not injured And you know there’s there’s
hematoma that is from the parenchyma of the kidney or surrounding
vessels ~~uh ~~or the renal artery is injured and Broncos you know
and and And if it’s certainly if it’s injured in thrombose by the time
you know an individual gets to it it’s probably too late The scheming
time or mosquito time to the kidney’s been too great and there’s not
going to be value of of ~~uh ~~of trying to reconstruct it in the
setting of trauma And so if it happens to be an in between and I say
well let’s say that a actually it is one of these cases where ~~uh
~~you know explore the The ~~uh ~~the zone two hematoma and a is
coming from a main renal artery ~~Um ~~then you know and there’s
flow in it but it’s bleeding Then I think the principles that we have
described ~~Uh ~~such as ~~uh ~~either primary repair ~~um uh
uh ~~four or five Oh ~~uh ~~potentially probably in this case
maybe a six O ~~uh ~~monofilament sutures such as proline It would
be useful if that appears to ~~uh ~~[00:47:00] compromise the lumen
and ~~um ~~either a patch angioplasty of that artery ~~Uh ~~or
you know a bypass But again that is extremely rare in the setting of
trauma ~~Um ~~you know if it’s going to require more than than a
primary repair ~~um ~~you know it’s I think in my experience equally
likely that ~~uh ~~you know you’re going to be ~~um ~~ligating
that vessel for damage control</p>
<p>~~Um Uh ~~but but it’s pretty rare to be doing a complex renal
artery repair in the setting of of trauma similar to the proximal SMA
injuries for example</p>
<p>It just pretty rare</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong> right Can you talk to us about your emotions You’re dealing
with your renal hematomas whether they’re Penetrating or blind I know
the old adage of every penetrating renal hematoma should be explored and
blood one should not be explored unless they’re expanding May not be
true but can you kind of walk us through how you approached this</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> Right So you know zone two this would be a you know zone
one or the central ~~uh ~~dominal hematomas and you know the rules
that [00:48:00] you’re alluding to or that you know almost all or all
zone one hematomas should be ~~uh ~~explored ~~um ~~Zone two
hematomas which are the kidneys in the lateral gutters ~~Uh uh
~~basically ~~um ~~you know <del>the the</del> the general rule is that
if it’s a ~~uh ~~expanding hematoma regardless if the mechanism is
blunt or penetrating then those hematomas Should be explored in zone two
~~Um ~~the general rule goes as most of your listeners know if it’s
a blunt injury ~~uh ~~and the zone two hematoma is not expanding
then that does not need to be explored ~~Um ~~In contrast if it’s a
zone to hematoma from a penetrating mechanism then most of the time
though than need to be explored even if the hematomas is stable Those
are the general rules that <del>we</del> we use to guide our approach to <del>zone
two a retroperitoneal or</del> zone to retroparotoneil hematoma So I use
those I think that’s ~~uh ~~those are pretty good ~~Um ~~You
know I ~~uh ~~I think there are times [00:49:00] when ~~uh ~~a
blunt ~~Uh ~~you know one finds themselves in in in in the belly
because there was a hemoperitoneum from a another injury And ~~and uh
and and ~~there is a blunt mechanism and there’s a zone two hematoma I
have explored those in the past And I think that if ~~uh ~~I don’t
think those guidelines are meant to be You know a dictums that can never
be ~~um ~~adjusted ~~uh <del>for an individual case</del> I’m not sure if
that ~~</p>
<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> So ~~uh ~~one question ~~Uh ~~I know a lot of times
many of these cases we don’t already have the laparotomy performed
~~Um ~~you know they’re in the trauma Bay They get a CT scan and
they they call and say there’s an intimal flap There’s a fistula maybe a
pseudo aneurysm and the renal artery ~~Um uh ~~any kind of general
principles for</p>
<p>some of these sort of</p>
<p>incidental findings</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> <del>and I think that’s a that’s probably a</del> so what you
described there is is the most obviously I guess the most common
scenario in which ~~which uh <del>which it’s a</del> uh~~ The CT finding
you know right in or just after the resuscitation room <del>of a of a</del> of
a main [00:50:00] renal artery injury ~~uh ~~branch renal artery
injury or maybe ~~uh ~~you know <del>uh</del> parenchymal injury to the
kidney <del>Um</del> and in those cases <del>um</del> I think if the <del>uh</del> let’s say
it’s the intimal flap that you described If the intimal flap is <del>uh</del>
Either not Mateen and there’s perfusion in the kid on that CT scan for
example ~~Um ~~and it does not appear to be flow limiting then that
can be observed ~~Uh ~~some of those like other blond arterial
injury some of those will heal ~~Um ~~if it is amenable to an
endovascular placement of a bare metal stent ~~uh ~~that Can be used
in some institutions to tack down ~~um ~~or stabilize that detection
~~Um ~~and that will be if if if you really feel like it is a flow
limiting more than 50% stenosis ~~uh ~~caused by that intimal flap
the more distal branch artery injuries can often also be managed with
endovascular techniques such as [00:51:00] coil embolization Replacement
of an ~~uh ~~occlusive ~~uh ~~you know hemostat coil or other
device ~~Um ~~and I think coil embolizing or or or treating those
depends upon ~~um ~~you know how the patient is doing how much blood
they’re requiring how large the hematoma is ~~Um ~~and then what
their hemodynamics are ~~Um ~~but I think for those reasons ~~uh
uh ~~what we described ~~uh ~~five or 10 minutes ago ~~um
~~having to fix these main <del>these</del> these renal artery injuries in
the ORs pretty uncommon because they’ve either been diagnosed and
managed ~~um ~~based off CT with or without endo Endovascular
technologies and oftentimes the management of a renal artery injury If
you’re in the or ~~uh ~~exploring and expanding you know hematoma
and one of the zone twos is is going to be nephrectomy you know ~~uh
~~because it’s it’s that major injury in which there’s just not ~~uh
~~there’s not the ~~uh ~~[00:52:00] indication for</p>
<p>repair</p>
<p><strong>Adham:</strong> <del>all the ranches of the aorta from the diaphragm Down to the
renals and Ima And</del> I want to thank you very very much for taking a
complex topic and it’s sort of convoluted in breaking it down from
technical steps to ~~uh ~~algorithms for exposure to how to repair I
think this was overall an excellent episode Well we haven’t touched on
the endovascular management of trauma which we’ll save for another
episode ~~Um ~~but thank you so much for for a great discussion I
for recipes</p>
<p><strong>Rasmussen:</strong> well I applaud you for tackling this ~~ ~~topic is
~~uh ~~unruly you know ~~it uh uh ~~both in the the anatomy
~~uh uh <del>the anatomic</del> ~~exposure ~~uh <del>operative exposure and
then the seemingly endless number of scenarios</del> Um <del>That can be

<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_krkniery_gmail.com.individual:</strong> [00:00:00] Okay,
and welcome back to behind the knife and audible bleeding vascular
trauma podcasts with our guest, Dr. Todd Rasmussen. Dr. Rasmussen is a
Colonel in the United States air force, and he’s a professor of surgery
and associate Dean of research at the uniform services university of
health science and an attending vascular surgeon at Walter Reed.</p>
<p>National military medical center. We’re continuing our [00:01:00] series
today on vascular trauma. He is the editor of the riches vascular
trauma, and he’s been gracious enough to join us and help us, ~~uh,
~~dive into these discussions. ~~Um, ~~and today we actually have,
~~uh, ~~one of my co-fellows and audible bleeding host, ~~uh,
~~Nicole Rich, ~~uh, ~~Nicole, thanks for joining.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_host.individual:</strong> Thanks for having me.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_krkniery_gmail.com.individual:</strong> ~~Um, ~~all
right, Dr. Rasmussen, ~~uh, ~~welcome back to audible bleeding.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_usuhs.edu.individual:</strong> Thanks a
lot for having me. I’m looking forward to, ~~uh, ~~to the
discussion.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_krkniery_gmail.com.individual:</strong> So we just want
to start with some of the basics here. ~~Um, ~~for the tenants of
managing patients with suspected cerebrovascular injuries, ~~um, ~~
what are some of the principles we have to keep in mind when we, when
we’re called the trauma Bay on a patient like this.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_usuhs.edu.individual:</strong> Well, I
think that, ~~uh, ~~there’s, there’s some, ~~uh, ~~of the key
tenants that are very much alike. I’m with the tenants of vascular
injury, ~~uh, ~~and other anatomic locations. ~~Um, ~~and then
there’s, there certainly are some unique facets to cerebrovascular
injury. That are different, ~~uh, ~~than, than other, anatomic
regions.</p>
<p>So, you know, I [00:02:00] think to begin with, ~~um, ~~the key
tenants that are, that are similar relate to, ~~uh, ~~bleeding
control. So that if, ~~uh, ~~if it is , in the cervical region or
the region of cerebrovascular, ~~uh, uh, ~~trauma, there’s active
bleeding then, then of course, that, ~~uh. Uh, ~~from the vascular
injury, then that takes precedent that we have to take measures either
with manual compression or, ~~uh, ~~other, other mechanisms to
control the bleeding and resuscitate the patient.</p>
<p>I think unlike other, ~~um, ~~vascular injury, ~~uh, ~~patterns,
cerebrovascular injury, or cervical, ~~uh, ~~vascular injury in the
cervical region also, ~~uh, ~~can quickly compromise the airway. And
so I think, ~~uh. ~~You know, those making sure that there’s control
of, of, of catastrophic bleeding, ~~uh, ~~and then making sure that,
~~uh, ~~that the vascular injury is not immediately compromising the
airway or are our two tenants that are</p>
<p>common with other vascular injury patterns and one is unique to this
area.[00:03:00] ~~Um, ~~and then I think also unique to this areas
is, ~~um, ~~the, the neuro status of the patient. ~~Uh, ~~is the
patient, ~~um, ~~awake or Tundra or asleep, or is the patient awake?
And does the patient have, ~~um, ~~signs of hemispheric. stroke,
~~uh, ~~or ischemia.</p>
<p>~~Um, ~~and I think depending upon, ~~uh, ~~the injury pattern
and the, the overall status of the patient, making a, ~~uh, ~~an
assessment and being particularly aware of the patient’s neuro status,
~~uh, ~~in, in these anatomic region is very important.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_krkniery_gmail.com.individual:</strong> Definitely. So,
~~um, ~~to highlight is in these patients, we want to prevent
secondary injury. ~~Um, ~~so, ~~um, ~~if they have a brain
injury, ~~um, ~~we’re going to. Do everything we can to keep their
blood pressure, prevent hypotension, prevent hypoxia. And then like dr
Rajistan and said, we really need to make sure we have a good neuro
exam.</p>
<p>as soon and as good of a neuro exam is as possible. ~~Um, and I know
the situation’s very, um, ~~</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_host.individual:</strong> ~~. ~~ So Dr. Rasmussen,
can you talk to us about what types of patients and what patterns of
injuries [00:04:00] should. ~~Uh, ~~Clewis into a potential for
blood carotid injury when we should have a high index of suspicion.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_usuhs.edu.individual:</strong> Sure. I
think there, ~~um, ~~certainly are on the physical exam. <del>Uh, there
are, there are</del> findings that will cue the provider, ~~uh, ~~to the
high suspicion for, ~~um. ~~A blunt carotid injury, ~~um, ~~most
commonly is some sort of external Mark on the neck, ~~uh, ~~or,
~~uh, ~~around the thoracic outlet of, ~~uh, ~~of the patient.
~~Um, ~~for example, a seatbelt Mark, ~~um, uh, ~~or some sort
of a choke Mark or such.</p>
<p>So if there’s external signs of injury, ~~um. Uh, ~~around the, the
color region of the cervical region of the patient. That certainly
should cue, ~~uh, ~~the provider end. I think there’s, there are,
~~um, uh, ~~I think other findings on physical exam, ~~um, ~~if
the patient <del>is,</del> has unilateral, ~~uh, ~~signs that suggest
hemispheric ischemia or a stroke, <del>um, I think</del> that is uncommon.</p>
<p>But I think that obviously. ~~Uh, ~~if the patient’s awake enough
and is demonstrating, ~~um, um. Um, ~~demonstrating physical
[00:05:00] findings that suggest a hemispheric aschemia or stroke. I
think that certainly is another, ~~uh, ~~another, ~~um,
~~finding that would cue someone in, ~~uh, ~~to looking more
closely for, ~~uh, ~~a blunt carotid injury.</p>
<p>I think the, the types of injuries, mechanisms of injury, I think I
mentioned the seatbelt injury, I mean, a car accident. <del>Um, for, um,
is, is,</del> is kind of a typical, ~~uh, ~~or common injury pattern in
civilian settings where, <del>um, you know, the,</del> the seatbelt itself has
caused a, ~~um, uh, ~~a blunt injury, ~~uh, ~~ after or during a
car accident.</p>
<p>So I think that is a mechanism of injury that should also, cue someone
in.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_krkniery_gmail.com.individual:</strong> Yeah, and I think
for the behind the knife listeners that are listening, ~~um, ~~it’s
really important to have this high index of suspicion because if you
guys don’t identify these as the trauma surgeons, as the general surgeon
on call, these patients can have devastating outcomes. So really being.
Alert and aware for these patients with complex facial fractures, these
<del>closed hit,</del> closed head injuries, and the seatbelt signs can really
save lives and get the [00:06:00] appropriate imaging to help rule in or
out a a carotid injury.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_usuhs.edu.individual:</strong> You know,
you mentioned, ~~um, ~~TBI or head injury, and I think that is,
that’s another obviously very common. Mechanism and unis blunt. Carotid
injury is pretty rare. ~~Um, ~~I think as vascular surgeons or
vascular. Trauma specialists, we tend to see them more frequently cause
we get called. ~~Uh, ~~but for, for, ~~um, ~~those providers who
are in the emergency department, ~~uh, ~~or are seeing <del>you know,</del>
all forms of trauma and presentation.</p>
<p>I think a TBI, traumatic brain injury, ~~um, uh, ~~head injury and
then complex facial fractures, those, as you alluded to, are. You know,
our injury patterns where when you’re looking both in examining the
patient, but then, you know, these days in particular, when you get the
CT scan, really paying attention to, you know, the cervical vasculature
is, is, is particularly important.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_host.individual:</strong> Great. And then just a couple
other injuries that keep in mind for this type of, ~~um,
~~presentation as [00:07:00] well would be ~~uh, ~~cervical
vertebral body fractures or transverse foramen fractures. And then also
just in patients who’ve had severe hyperextension rotation, reflection
injuries of the neck.</p>
<p>Okay, great. So how do we classify and think about treating injuries
with, ~~um, ~~blunt credit injuries? What’s our grading system and
how does that dictate how we manage these.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_usuhs.edu.individual:</strong> Well, I
think that as we think about this one thinks about, the anatomy of the
vessel wall, the arterial wall. that helps us conceptualize the degree
or the severity of, of these blood carotid injuries. They can be,
~~um, ~~as simple as a, as an intimal tear, ~~uh, ~~where,
~~um, ~~you know, it is, the intimate has been raised off of the
media and it creates a minor flow defect.</p>
<p>~~Uh, ~~which may be prone to platelet aggregation. ~~Um, ~~but
it’s, it’s not a, ~~uh, ~~a long dissection and it’s, it’s not a
flow limiting defect, and that is the [00:08:00] most minor. ~~Uh,
~~and then of course, the most severe on the other end of the spectrum
is a blond carotid injury. That’s resulted in. In, in complete
thrombosis of the artery so that, ~~uh, ~~it’s either the vessel has
been transected from the blunt injury and is thrombosis or, ~~uh,
~~or the, the injury is this, such that the intimate is lifted up and
it has created a longer this section that is, that is now thrombosed and
occluded the vessel.</p>
<p>And then there’s the degrees of injury between those two extremes where.
There can be a longer does section, ~~um, ~~that, has thrombus
associated with it and is visible on the cat scan or the imaging
modality, ~~um, ~~and or, ~~um, ~~a dissection that can be flow
limiting the defect that can be flow limiting.</p>
<p>They may not have thrombus and it, or B along the section, but it, but
it is in itself flow limiting, meaning that it. It’s, ~~uh, ~~
compromises greater than 50%, for example, [00:09:00] of the, of the
lumen of that pestle. So, you know, the, the varying degrees of
severity, ~~um, ~~you know, with our imaging technologies today,
mostly CTA, it is possible to pick up, you know, or is.</p>
<p>If you’re able to pick up or proceed the different, ~~uh, ~~types of
severity from a, again, from a real mild intimal defect that’s not flow
limiting, that has no thrombus all the way to the more obvious, ~~uh,
~~you know, ~~uh, uh, ~~injury where there’s complete thrombosis.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_krkniery_gmail.com.individual:</strong> Is there any role
for ultrasound, ~~uh, ~~in addition to CTA, if you do see some sort
of intimal flap, ~~uh, ~~to maybe see the, if there’s any
hemodynamic impact of it, or is it. Does CTA give you the information
that you need.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_usuhs.edu.individual:</strong> I think
that’s a really good point. I love, I really like ultrasound. I think
you alluded to this, ~~um, ~~with your comment, you know, CT gives
you, gives one a static image. ~~Uh, ~~it’s often quite detailed
and, ~~uh, ~~boy, I really also think that CTA [00:10:00] is, I
mean, in many ways it is the gold standard, but it is a static image.</p>
<p>Yeah. In contrast, duplex ultrasound, which combines B mode, you know,
ultrasonography with POLST Doppler ~~uh, ~~gives one a real dynamic,
~~um, <del>assessment of the area of interest.</del> Meaning is, is the, um,
is there,~~ I mentioned the word flow limiting is, is there a elevated
velocity and a detriment in, in, in.</p>
<p>Or a change or a difference in the velocities around that area. So I
think, I think you can get a lot of information with duplex though. Of
course, the limitation with duplex, and we may talk about this, ~~um,
~~when we talk about the different zones of. Of of, of neck injury,
you know, the, the limitation with duplex is it, it you cannot see above
the angle of the mandible.</p>
<p>So you quickly kind of run out of real estate distally where you can use
duplex. It’s not good for distal internal carotid injuries and you
cannot see, you know, proximal to the thoracic outlet. [00:11:00] So,
you know, there is a limited window in which duplex is useful. But,
~~uh, ~~but in that window, I think it gives really important
information.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_host.individual:</strong> That’s a great point. So going
back to the grading of the injuries, ~~uh, ~~Dr. Rasmussen, you
described to us a grade one and grade two injuries, which involve
intimal injuries, ~~uh, ~~less than 25% in grade one or grade two
with a greater than 25% luminal narrowing. ~~Um, ~~can you talk
about the management of grade one and two injuries.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_usuhs.edu.individual:</strong> Yeah, I
think I’m grade one and grade two injuries. ~~Um. ~~Most of the time
are managed non-operatively and can be managed expectantly with, ~~uh,
~~use of antiplatelet therapy, potentially anticoagulation. ~~Um,
~~depending upon, ~~um, ~~the patient’s global burden of trauma.
Do they have an associated TBI? Do they have other, other injuries?</p>
<p>But. ~~Um, ~~if, if there are, if the patient is [00:12:00]
neurologically intact, ~~um, ~~and a grade one or grade two injury
is seen on imaging, ~~um, ~~and the patient is able to have
anti-platelet or anticoagulation therapy, then those, those types of
great injuries, grade one and grade two are managed. Non-operatively,
~~uh, ~~with, ~~uh, ~~I guess you’d say medical management.</p>
<p>If the patient changes, meaning that he or she was initially
neurologically normal, ~~um, ~~and medical management is initiated
and then the patient changes has hemispheric symptoms indicating that
your medical management is failing. Then that is a situation where,
~~uh, ~~an intervention is, is this likely to be needed or would be
indicated, ~~um, ~~if that makes sense.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_krkniery_gmail.com.individual:</strong> That drives me is
to have a question. ~~Um, ~~ have you ever been in a situation where
you have a grade one or two injury, but a [00:13:00] patient that you’re
unable to get a neuro exam on? Are we obligated to, ~~um, ~~ask for
things such as transcranial Doppler or EEG or, or, or something to prove
that there’s no injury from that <del>or, you know,</del> what are your
thoughts on a situation like that?</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_usuhs.edu.individual:</strong> Great
question, and I think I’m. I’ll probably use this phrase multiple times
in this discussion. Is it? It depends, ~~um, ~~partly it depends on
what modalities, one has available to them in their institution, but I
think the answer to that, if I could, ~~um, ~~if I come down from on
it, is, no, you’re not obligated.</p>
<p>I think it’s a luxury. ~~Uh, ~~that some places may have that if you
have access to EEG or transcranial Doppler, it might be able to be used
or sort of a luxury in your diagnosis, but I don’t think that’s really
necessary. I would mostly treat them, as I said, with medical management
and then imaging, serial [00:14:00] imaging, both.</p>
<p>Of their neck and, of their brain. ~~Um, ~~and I think in a way, and
then you mentioned it earlier, Kevin, I thought that was really
important. ~~Uh, ~~supportive measures, like preventing, secondary
injury, you know, which means optimize the profusion pressure to the
brain. ~~Uh, ~~try to avoid or lessen the likelihood of secondary
insults such as hypotension, shock and, and such.</p>
<p>So I don’t think you’re obligated to get those things. I think that
things like EEG, transcranial Doppler are more in the category of a
luxury if you have them. ~~Um, ~~but otherwise I would manage with a
serial imaging.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_host.individual:</strong> So Dr. Rasmussen in a patient
who remains neurologically intact and you plan to, ~~um, ~~that
medically manage and do serial imaging, what’s the best timing for
repeat imaging?</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_usuhs.edu.individual:</strong> Yeah,
that’s a great question. And I, I think, ~~um, ~~for, ~~um,
~~for patients that we manage and in my experience, we manage, we at
least image him twice in the hospital. While they’re an [00:15:00]
inpatient. So, ~~uh, ~~to make sure that they’re not changing or
evolving, you know, in the acute phase of their injury. So, ~~um,
~~you know, if, ~~uh, ~~if, <del>uh.</del></p>
<p>The typical patient is someone with a, you know, with a blunt, ~~um,
~~head injury and they have a finding at the time of, ~~uh, ~~of a
grade one or grade two carotid injury. ~~Um, ~~we get the CT at the
time. They’re admitted to diagnose it. We follow them, you know, over
the course of three or four or five days as they recover from their
injury.</p>
<p>They need another imaging study, I think within, you know, within the
first week to make sure that that. Grade one or grade two injury has not
evolved into an either a pseudo aneurysm, because remember, there’s a,
by definition, a disruption of the arterial wall or an extension, you
know, from a grade one or grade two into something that’s more, more
significant.</p>
<p>So I think the initial scan on admission, of course, and then within the
first seven days to make sure they’ve not, that injuries not evolving.
~~Um, ~~[00:16:00] and then typically after that, I think, again, it
depends on. ~~Um, ~~sort of the severity and how the patient’s
doing, but probably at a month after discharge from the hospital and
then most of them will heal.</p>
<p>~~Uh, ~~certainly grade ones will heal, hopefully grade two, but,
but they do need followed, ~~uh, ~~to the point of resolution or
healing as an outpatient. ~~Uh, ~~usually with CT scans or CTA.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_host.individual:</strong> Okay, great. And series of
these patients have shown that 60% of them will have their injuries
devolve or change in greater severity in this period. Is the pattern
that you see typically that they tend to improve over time?</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_usuhs.edu.individual:</strong> Well, I
think the, ~~um, ~~I think the grade, you know, the grade ones,
~~uh, ~~I think they do. ~~Um, ~~they’re, those are the ones
where that’s a minor or limited intimal disruption. A small intimal flap
that. that is not flow limiting. It’s not associated with thrombus or
platelet aggregation or thrombus.</p>
<p>So I think most of the grade ones do, and I [00:17:00] think, I’m sure
the grade twos, I think it certainly a greater percentage of those are
prone to evolve into, you know, a longer deception formation of thrombus
around them or into a pseudo aneurysm. And so that’s the, the point of,
of serial imaging. You know, within the first week of the injury.</p>
<p>~~Uh, ~~and then certainly, you know, ~~uh, ~~another one within
the first month of the injury he had at best case, certainly if they
begin to evolve or you see on that second CT. That the image that the
injury’s changing, let’s say it’s a grade two to your point that you
think and you see signs that it’s evolving, then by all means then that
that needs then more intensive imaging and likely if it’s evolving into
something more significant, it needs an intervention.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_host.individual:</strong> Okay, so a pseudo aneurysm is
what we consider grade three. what is your approach to managing a pseudo
aneurysm of the carotid?</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_usuhs.edu.individual:</strong> Yeah, so I
think the, the suitor aneurysms [00:18:00] of the carotid, ~~um,
~~you know, that in a way it depends. It’s influenced certainly on,
~~um, ~~the patient’s neuro status or the location of the pseudo
aneurism. And then I think the expertise of, of the team that’s managing
the patient. ~~Um, ~~but I think that the pseudo aneurysms, ~~um,
~~all of them, no matter what size they, they need to be treated,
~~they, they require, um, you know, um, ~~they require an
intervention to fix them.</p>
<p>~~Um, ~~there certainly are some patients who, <del>um. Who’s you
know,</del> have a high mortality. They, they’re, they’re, they’re quite ill
or have a high, high injury severity score. They may not make it.
There’s some patients that one may pass and not fix a pseudo aneurysm or
grade three entry, but by and large, most do because the pseudo
aneurysms will.</p>
<p>~~Uh, will, um, ~~they will not go away. Then they’re likely to get
bigger and become associated with either expansion and mass effect or
bleeding or thrombus formation, stroke. ~~Um, ~~so, ~~um, ~~the,
the ways to treat them, I think are [00:19:00] these days primarily with
endovascular techniques that include covering, ~~uh, ~~the pseudo
aneurysm with a small coverage stent.</p>
<p>Or what we’d call a stent graft, a small covered stent to seal the, the
opening of the pseudo aneurysm. You know, there are some reports and
experiences using what we call a bare metal stent, ~~um, ~~through
which coils can be placed to thrombose the pseudo aneurysm to cause it
to clot. And then the bare metal stent then, you know, maintains the
integrity of the wall.</p>
<p>~~Um. ~~Such that, flow is maintained through the, through the
lumen, those both use of a stent graft or recovered stent or coiling of
the pseudo aneurysm, or interventional techniques or endovascular
techniques that are performed most commonly through a transfemoral
approach, an RJ order gram, and then selection of the.</p>
<p>of the [00:20:00] effected carotid artery and then placement of the, of
the endovascular treatment. ~~Um, ~~I think those, these days are
probably the most common. Certainly if, it is, ~~um, ~~in, you know,
in zone two of the neck, and we can talk about that a little bit.
~~Uh, ~~and it’s amenable to an operation. ~~Um, ~~there’s
another indication for an operation in that area than, than certainly
open repair of the pseudo aneurysm can also be.</p>
<p>Undertaken, but I think more commonly these days for grade two injuries,
they’re managed with an endovascular technique.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_krkniery_gmail.com.individual:</strong> In your book,
it’s mentioned that, ~~um, ~~considering waiting seven days to
decrease neuro events, ~~uh, ~~ what’s the thought behind this?</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_usuhs.edu.individual:</strong> <del>Yeah,
definitely. I think that, if a patient, um. You know, Harrigan, it
depends.</del> I think that it depends on the patient. There are some
patients who just are in no shape to undergo. ~~Um, you know, uh, uh,
~~an intervention such as this in the acute, ~~uh, ~~in the acute
setting, the first two or three days and, and certainly in those
patients waiting is, is just, you don’t have a choice.</p>
<p>You need to wait. I think Yeah. If the patients, ~~um, ~~[00:21:00]
you know, are awake, let’s say they’re awake and otherwise normal,
~~um, ~~you know, in those patients, if they’re, if it’s a pseudo
aneurysm, the patient’s awake and, ~~uh, ~~able to be examined. I, I
often don’t wait seven days. I think the waiting period probably more
pertains to patients with polytrauma, maybe an associated TBI and, and
a, and a more complex, ~~uh, ~~complex course.</p>
<p>I think if it’s more. A cut and dry, the patient’s awake, ~~uh,
~~able to be examined. They’re out of the unit. ~~Uh, ~~then I
don’t wait necessarily seven days.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_krkniery_gmail.com.individual:</strong> Got it. So,
~~uh, ~~for the grade four injuries, ~~uh, ~~the occlusions, we
just do medical management for these patients if they’re already
included. can you just talk to us briefly about, how you decide on
medical management, whether you were using anti-platelets or dual
anti-platelets or anticoagulation?</p>
<p>How do you go about this?</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_usuhs.edu.individual:</strong> Yeah. So
this is really, ~~um, ~~an area where ~~it is, um, ~~you know,
we don’t have a lot of good, we don’t have really any good data. We
have. [00:22:00] Really good clinical experiences by a lot of expert
groups, but we don’t have a lot of, ~~um, ~~ prospective data or
level one data that guides our management in these cases.</p>
<p>~~Um, ~~and so I think, ~~um, ~~ patients with occluded, let’s
say a blunt carotid and secluded grade for injury, ~~um, ~~patients
who do not have associated injuries or conditions. That preclude the use
of anticoagulation, then I will use the anticoagulation. We’ll, we’ll
give them, ~~uh, ~~intravenous heparin, ~~um, ~~and, ~~um,
~~monitor them with repeat imaging and obviously, ~~um, ~~monitor
them to make sure they’re not over anticoagulated in pain.</p>
<p>And that tends to be the exception because many of these patients have
polytrauma, so they have an associated TBI. Or other body regions that
have been severely injured. So that anticoagulation is not an option.
And in those cases, ~~uh, ~~we are really left with using, ~~um.
Uh, ~~[00:23:00] an antiplatelet like, ~~um, ~~clopidogrel or
aspirin.</p>
<p>In those cases, I’ll often use both, ~~uh, ~~dual antiplatelet
therapy, clopidogrel and aspirin. And these are in patients who cannot
receive full anticoagulation because of other injuries. ~~Um, ~~one
point there, I think if, if one’s going to use anticoagulation, and I
think this group, ~~Um, ~~you know, Kevin, you and Nicole are, and
those of us who get called frequently for bleeding complications are
sensitive to this.</p>
<p>But in these, these patients, we’re going to use anticoagulation on for
a blunt grade four blond carotid injury. I really try to avoid, ~~uh,
~~protocol based, bolusing. Of anticoagulation. I think our internal
medicine friends and often our intensivist get into these protocols
where they’ll use large boluses of heparin as if the patient’s being
treated for a PE.</p>
<p>And I think that, I try to avoid that because I, in my experience, that
leads to [00:24:00] bleeding complications either in the brain. The neck
or somewhere else in these injured patients. So I typically will, when I
start anticoagulation on these patients start pretty slow with a goal
PTT of 50 to 70 and in the first 24 hours, I often will say 50 is better
than 70 because these patients with this type of trauma are just prone
to bleed.</p>
<p>~~Um, ~~and then work up slowly to therapeutic anticoagulation
without boluses. ~~Um, ~~ and again, these are patients that they
use the anticoagulation and the don’t have on the, they shouldn’t have
other major injuries. So then they get transitioned to an oral
anticoagulant for, 30 to 90 days.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_krkniery_gmail.com.individual:</strong> That’s a really
good point.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_host.individual:</strong> Okay, great. So why don’t we
move on to discuss blend for tibial artery. Injuries, ~~um, ~~Dr.
Rasmussen, when you’re assessing a patient’s imaging who is presenting
with a trauma and a blunt vertebral artery injury, what are the kinds of
things that you look for in terms of the dominance of the
vertebral,[00:25:00] ~~um, ~~and how that affects your management?</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_usuhs.edu.individual:</strong> Yeah, good
point. And you’ve used. Kindly, ~~uh, uh, tips, um, ~~pointing me in
the right direction. I think it, depends upon, you know, one of the main
things is, ~~uh, ~~well, first of all, starting with a physical
exam, and as we’ve mentioned, you know, how, how is the patient, when
you first assess them, do they have.</p>
<p>No signs of bleeding in the neck, airway compromise, et cetera. But
then, you know, quickly with these patients, and to your point, you get
to the imaging and, and I think one of the key things is it, which
vertebral, is it the dominant vertebral artery that is affected? Or is
it the diminutive, ~~um, ~~for TBL? Or, or maybe you can’t tell.</p>
<p>~~Um, ~~but I think that is important. ~~Um, ~~and then I think,
It’s similar in some ways to the carotid injuries. It’s the severity of
that vertebral injury, both its location, ~~um, ~~anatomically which
of the vertebral segments. And then, you know, what is the, what is the
severity of the injury?</p>
<p>Is that a mild. grade one intimal flap [00:26:00] that’s sort of seems
non flow limiting, or is it a full full blown occlusion, ~~uh, uh,
~~of the vertebral? And then lastly, is it associated with a baseline
artery defactor posterior circulation, stroke? Those are sort of the
things that I try to go through in my mind.</p>
<p>~~Um. ~~As I look at the imaging, you know, one thing that’s
important to mention, and we were just talking about this with one of
our residents or trainees, ~~uh, ~~last week we did a first rib
resection and talked about, ~~um, ~~the severity of, of impact that
it takes to make these ~~create these sorts of ~~sorts of injuries.</p>
<p>You know, I think. What I would say is yes, be focused on the vertebral
artery, or in the case of the carotid, be focused on the carotid, but
also be aware that in, oftentimes these cases can be associated with
other torso, vascular injuries, blunt aortic injuries and such. So, you
know, like, like we always try to do ourselves or teach.</p>
<p>You know, don’t get tunnel [00:27:00] vision with these patients. Look
at their imaging with regards to the vertebral, but also be aware that,
~~uh, ~~they often have other injuries that you need to open the
aperture to see.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_krkniery_gmail.com.individual:</strong> That’s great.
from my experience, ~~uh, ~~most of these injuries of the routine
rules are managed non-operatively or occasionally with embolization,
maybe, ~~um, ~~by neuro, I R. unless there’s maybe a pseudo
aneurysm, and per your book, 90% of these stenotic lesions will resolve.
~~Um. ~~Is that the experience that you have to,</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_usuhs.edu.individual:</strong> Yes. And I
think the, you know, this, they fall into a similar management pattern,
is the blunt carotid injuries. ~~Um, ~~maybe not quite the same
because their natural history is a little different, but, but I think
the, you know, as far as serial imaging, ~~um, ~~management with,
~~uh, ~~either expectant medical management for burn for those that
are, that are less severe, and then endovascular management.</p>
<p>~~Um, ~~with those that are more severe, I think, you know, in a
way, they do fall into a [00:28:00] similar management pattern. And yes,
~~uh, ~~the majority of those that, ~~uh, ~~that are low grade
do resolve for or become asymptomatic over the long period. Meaning they
may, the receivable may, may, if it’s thrombosis, I mean, oftentimes
that does not result in.</p>
<p>Stroke. It just, depends, you know, but many of the smaller injuries
certainly do resolve over time. ~~Uh, ~~and, and that can be seen
with the serial imaging approach that we’ve already talked about.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_host.individual:</strong> So Dr. Rasmussen, ~~um,
~~Kevin mentioned that a lot of these vertebral injuries, especially
if they’re kind of high up. In the neck or the skull base are managed by
neuro IRR or conservatively, but if you need to expose the proximal
vertebral artery in the neck, what’s your approach for that surgically.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_usuhs.edu.individual:</strong> Right? So
that’s a, that is exposed through a supraclavicular incision. ~~Um,
~~and for those who have, ~~um. ~~Looked at up or [00:29:00]
performed, ~~um, ~~ a carotid subclavian bypass, for example, or
the, the exposure of the subclavian artery. Most mostly that exposure,
or most commonly that supraclavicular incision is, is described for
exposure of the, the, of the subclavian artery.</p>
<p>~~Um, ~~but through that same supraclavicular exposure, ~~um.
~~No, the vertebral artery can be found a little bit more proximal on
the subclavian artery. So that’s, that’s sort of the, that’s the, that’s
the incision or approach. ~~Um, ~~and you know, it depends upon
<del>the, you know, one, um, you know,</del> what one is operating for, if
it’s, if it’s for, for bleeding and the intent is to, to control
bleeding or ligated, that’s actually most commonly.</p>
<p>The case, I mean, is, is that, ~~uh, ~~you know, that exposure is
then used because it’s a hematoma and, and there’s, ~~uh, ~~there’s
bleeding. ~~Um, ~~you know, then the intent is to expose, ~~uh,
um, ~~the, the vertebral is, it comes off of the, the subclavian and
to [00:30:00] litigate it, it’s rare that one would be repairing or
trying to restore flow in the setting of trauma.</p>
<p>~~Um, ~~to the vertebral artery, you know, through that incision. We
don’t really typically do for Teebo reconstructions for trauma.
typically if you’re doing it through an open operation, it’s really to
control bleeding and, and, ~~uh, ~~ probably gonna end up lying
eight in it, just because a re implanting the vertebral, you know, on
the common carotid or doing some sort of achievable reconstruction is
just not well suited for for the trauma situation, if that makes sense.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_krkniery_gmail.com.individual:</strong> Yeah. And one
quick thing before we move on, I just wanted to touch you on a paragraph
that I took from your book. ~~Um, ~~that I think is really important
because we don’t do. Artery exposure as much. I’ve only really done one
in fellowship. I’ve been a lot of credit subclavians where I see it, but
an actual exposure for TB and your book, it mentions you go in between
the two heads of the SCM.</p>
<p>~~Um, ~~you open up the credit chief and you retract the carotid
immediately, and this will you, then you’ll be able to identify this is
a critical [00:31:00] structure of the vertebral vein, which directly
posterior, which is directly posterior to the carotid. And this
vertebral vein is sort of a landmark that helps you identify the
vertebral artery and the proximal subclavian artery.</p>
<p>And the one of these that I’ve done that was exactly the, ~~um,
~~anatomic, exposure</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_usuhs.edu.individual:</strong> Yeah. Good
point. We didn’t tie, I didn’t talk about the anatomy or the specific
anatomical aspects. That’s exactly right. I mean, I think one of the
things, a couple of things that are useful in addition to to the
vertebral vein, I think that, ~~um. ~~I think that identifying, the
sternal head and the clavicular head of the sternocleidomastoid, you
know, and trying to find it really in a lot of ways, you can go between
those two heads of the sternocleidomastoid.</p>
<p>~~Um, ~~and it’s in that sort of, that groove there where one can,
~~um, ~~and, and oftentimes that’s just a, I mean, it is, there’s an
open plane there between the, ~~and if you can look at your anatomy
book, kind of get that out and see the. ~~The sternal head and the
clinic killer had, ~~uh, ~~really the window there, ~~um, ~~lead
you then, <del>you know,</del> to that area where posteriorly, there [00:32:00]
will be the, the vertebral artery will come off.</p>
<p>And so claiming, ~~um, ~~you know, you can feel the carotid, ~~um,
~~ and it’s just beyond, ~~um, ~~it’s just beyond the takeoff, at
least on the right is just beyond the takeoff of the carotid artery.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_krkniery_gmail.com.individual:</strong> <del>Great. And now
that we’re kind of talking about operations and we’re going to keep
diving into penetrating injuries of the neck. So dr , we just want to
just kind of start with some of the basics, uh, when we’re talking about
the zones of the neck, uh, and, and what are the anatomic considerations
of each of these zones.</del></p>
<p><del>Um, can you just tell us what zone one is and kind of what you’re
thinking of if you hear of a vascular injury in this area?</del></p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_usuhs.edu.individual:</strong> ~~Yeah,
so, you know, so zone one, so the zones of the neck, you know, really,
um, refer to the, um, the anterior, um, aspects of the neck. Um, and so
the, the sort of the anterior triangles of the neck, and, um. The zone
one really is, is the most proximal. It’s the inferior, uh, aspects of
the, um, uh, of that, of that. ~~</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_krkniery_gmail.com.individual:</strong> So doctor asked
me, he said, I think we’re going to dive now into penetrating carotid
trauma and start with sort of the basics, ~~uh, ~~diving into the
zones of the neck and some of the things you take into consideration
with each of these zones in the neck as far as getting control.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_usuhs.edu.individual:</strong> So ~~um,
~~the zones of the neck, ~~um, ~~that <del>are,</del> have been used to
help us conceptualize, <del>um, you know,</del> penetrating injury mostly.
<del>Uh. Oh,</del> really? Apply to the anterior portion of the neck. <del>Uh,
kind of</del> the anterior triangle of the neck. ~~Um, ~~ zone one is,
is the,~~ is the, uh, is the sort of the~~ first and the most, <del>I
guess.</del></p>
<p>~~Um, ~~proximal zone, and it’s really defined, ~~um, ~~by the
sternal notch to the cricoid cartilage. So it’s a tight or narrow zone
that really involves the thoracic outlet. ~~Um, ~~zone two is the
cricoid cartilage to the angle of the mandible, which is, <del>um, sort
of</del> the largest of the, of the three zones, ~~uh, ~~in the
[00:33:00] neck, the intern neck.</p>
<p>And then zone three is from the angle of the mandible to the base of the
skull. Like, zone one’s on three’s pretty tight. ~~Um, ~~there’s not
a lot of space there. ~~Um, ~~and those zones, ~~um, ~~I think
are useful and that have been described. ~~Uh, ~~there was original
paper led by, ~~um, ~~dr rune, R O, N, H, J rune, ~~and, uh, uh,
~~in the journal of trauma in 1979 that, first described <del>those,</del>
those zones, ~~um, ~~it was called evaluation and treatment of
penetrating cervical, ~~uh, ~~injuries and in those zones I think
are really useful just <del>as a,</del> to help us conceptualize into, to try
to, ~~uh, ~~manage, different forms of penetrating injury or
different areas of penetrating injury.</p>
<p>~~Um, ~~so those are the zones. ~~Uh, ~~I think that. <del>You
know,</del> teaching, ~~uh, ~~at least over the years has been the,
penetrating injuries to zone one and zone three largely, ~~um,
~~require, <del>you know,</del> imaging at the outset. ~~Um, ~~and maybe
either non-operative repair or at least imaging first ~~with, uh,
~~because they’re very difficult areas to expose penetrating injuries
to [00:34:00] zone two.</p>
<p>~~Um, <del>traditionally</del> have been in~~ the teaching has been that
those are all managed with, ~~uh, ~~an open operation and
exploration of the neck.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_krkniery_gmail.com.individual:</strong> ~~Um, ~~and
then for zone three, <del>sort of, I think,</del> much like zone one, ~~uh,
~~ we depend on <del>sort of</del> imaging and angiography, ~~uh, ~~for
treatment of these injuries. kind of want to dive straight into this
and, ~~uh, ~~discuss how do we manage credit injuries. So we’re,
we’re going to just pitch some scenarios at you and we, can discuss some
of the nuances of it.</p>
<p>~~Um. ~~If you have a penetrating carotid injury, ~~um, ~~ zone
two, ~~uh, ~~and the patient is neuro intact. <del>Um, I mean,</del> it’s
this kind of the most straightforward situation. <del>But, uh, I guess, I
guess a better question to you is, is ,</del> if they’re neurologically
intact, how do we determine whether or not you’re going to repair the
credit injury</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_usuhs.edu.individual:</strong> <del>Yeah. I</del>
well, I think probably the case-based scenarios are probably best
because. ~~You know, each management, um, ~~as I mentioned, the
zones are there to provide some conceptualization, help us to categorize
our management. But, ~~uh, ~~the, management of any given cases is
often, individualized.</p>
<p>So in this particular case, yes, I mean, whether or [00:35:00] not
they’re, ~~um, ~~neurologically intact certainly matters. ~~Um,
~~I think with penetrating zone to injury, ~~um. ~~I would still
operate on that. ~~I think that, that, that, um, ~~ I think that
paradigm is changing with modern imaging technologies, CTA mostly,
~~um, ~~and clinical experience.</p>
<p>But I think that teaching is in the case that you’ve presented a
<del>penetrating zone to neck injury with a carotid or</del> penetrating zone
to wound with a carotid injury, then that patient would be. Operated on
with an open operation.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_krkniery_gmail.com.individual:</strong> the neurodeficit
portion of it, <del>um, you know,</del> historically there was concerns over if
you repair this carotid injury, <del>um, you know,</del> that you could create
intercranial hemorrhage. So, say you have a patient that comes in with a
zone, two injury <del>with, uh, you know,</del> on the right neck with.
Left-sided neuro symptoms. <del>Um, w what are your thoughts on that?
Does,</del> does the neuro status play into it or do you repair, the
carotid.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_usuhs.edu.individual:</strong> Yeah, I
think that, and these days, you know, as I mentioned or alluded to, we
have the benefit of CT imaging. So, <del>you know, the,</del> the [00:36:00]
paradigm of that <del>was.</del> I mentioned the, AGA rune paper from 1979
~~and ~~that really set up the, the zones, ~~you know, that was in
really, um, ~~that was in an era where we did not have, and for many
decades after that, we didn’t really have the benefit of routine high
quality contrast CT imaging.</p>
<p>Today we’re operating ~~in that, uh, ~~in this new era with.
Routine, <del>high contrast or</del> high quality contrast CT scan. So, ~~um,
~~I think in your case, <del>you know it,</del> if the injury has a CT scan,
~~um, ~~which is likely to have these days unless the, unless the
injury was associated with bleeding and the patient was just taken
immediately to the, or, you’re going to have a CT image.</p>
<p>If the CT image shows. <del>You know,</del> a grade one type of injury, you
almost extrapolating the, you know, the, the blunt characterization or
the blunt categories. If it’s zone one, then I suppose, <del>you know,
those may also,</del> you ~~know, ~~may not choose to operate on those,
but I think penetrating wounds, I would, [00:37:00] I would operate on
them <del>and I think, um.</del></p>
<p><del>No.</del> Cause I think they’re going to evolve. And <del>they,</del> the other
thing about exploring zone to the neck is that you can explore for
other~~ Aerojet <del>aerodigestive injuries.</del> I mean that,~~ that’s
the other dictum or part of this is to make sure that there’s not an
injury to the, ~~to the, uh, ~~to the airway or to the esophagus,
<del>as, as,</del> as you perform the zone to neck exploration.</p>
<p>So, ~~um. ~~You know, I think that they get, ~~uh, ~~ an
exploration. <del>They get a,</del> you see the carotid, ~~uh, ~~and
~~uh, uh, ~~you explore and you see the injury and then you manage
it depending upon what the injury looks like at the time of open
exploration. <del>I mean, it’s hard.</del> I think it would be hard for me to
sit on a penetrating zone to wound that has a.</p>
<p>Carotid injury, I, it’s potentially described. ~~Um, uh, and I think,
um, ~~but I think, ~~um, ~~there’s a couple of reasons that I
would err on the side of, of operating on that.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_krkniery_gmail.com.individual:</strong> Yeah. And I
think, ~~uh, ~~historically, they talked about, <del>like I
mentioned,</del> the intercranial hemorrhage. So if you had, ~~say, a, uh,
~~a very, ~~uh, ~~beat [00:38:00] up looking carotid artery,
~~um, ~~or maybe. near thrombosis that they would leave it, ~~um,
~~because they’re afraid of reproducing the brain, causing
intracranial hemorrhage.</p>
<p>But it seems like the consensus now, at least from your book and the
East guidelines is, <del>to repair these deficits, uh, or</del> to repair these
credit injuries because the mortality and final <del>nerdy</del> neuro status,
~~uh, ~~has been shown to be better in these patients. even if they
started with a neurodeficit.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_usuhs.edu.individual:</strong> And I think
that <del>we, you know, as vascular surgeons who do carotid endarterectomy,
uh, routinely, I think we’re more so, I don’t, I do not. So, first of
all, this is a complex, uh. Complex scenario. So I, I’m definitely won’t
throw shade on any previous experiences with this sort of heroin, um,
injury pattern.</del></p>
<p><del>I do think that we, um. You know,</del> for those of us who <del>manage and</del>
perform carotid endarterectomy routinely, we <del>sort of are,</del> are
familiar,~~ I guess, when maybe not good with it, but we’re at least
familiar~~ with trying to mitigate hyperperfusion syndrome or
reprofusion syndrome. And I think that is, <del>um, you know, that’s just</del>
part of the, the management.</p>
<p>There’s the technical management of the injury, and then there’s the
communication with anesthesia to try to lower the blood pressure and the
overall profusion pressure. ~~Um, ~~in these patients after you
repair the carotid, ~~um, ~~it’s not unlike communicating with
anesthesia about resuscitation, right?</p>
<p>We need to, communicate with anesthesia in this case, to mitigate
hyperperfusion or reprofusion and worsening of a brain injury. We,
<del>we,</del> need to, ~~uh, ~~[00:39:00] communicate with anesthesia as
well as do a good job of fixing the, the injury.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_host.individual:</strong> That is a great point. ~~Um,
~~what about in a situation where you have a patient who has a large
infarct. On the same side as a carotid injury. What is your approach in
that situation?</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_usuhs.edu.individual:</strong> Yeah. So I
think, ~~um, ~~you know, and it depends upon the injury. ~~ you
know, I think~~ if this is a penetrating zone to wound. <del>Um, you
know,</del> in nearly all instances, <del>you know, so</del> you’re going to
explore it. ~~Um, ~~because it’s his own two neck injury. <del>Um, I
mean, I, I think, um. You know? Okay. So there may be some that are,
that are sort of there.</del></p>
<p><del>I’m trying to avoid the words. It depends. Um, you know, I suppose
there are some minor penetrating injuries where the, the image, uh, you
know, it’s a small stab wound or ice pick type of thing. Uh, in, in, in,
there’s, there’s, there’s no hematoma. It’s looks like there’s a injury
to the carotid. That’s, uh, that’s, that’s, uh.</del></p>
<p>~~Uh, resulted in, uh, in an infarct or a stroke, but there’s no
bleeding or pseudo aneurysm. Um, there might be scenarios where you
would observe it. I, I don’t, that’s not a practice that I, a spouse.
~~I would explore all of these. I still sort of fall, fall back on
exploring all penetrating zone two injuries. ~~Um, ~~and in that
case then you’re going to be in the neck anyway.</p>
<p>You’re going to see the injury to the carotid. And I guess your
question. Nicole is in the setting of an infarct, would you then repair
the carotid? ~~Um, ~~I mean, your options are either to repair it,
do nothing to it or, or lie gated and I guess as a vascular surgeon,
<del>um, you know,</del> I would repair it. ~~Um, ~~I think observing
[00:40:00] it while you’re there looking at it is then you risk it
evolving into a pseudo aneurysm and you having to re operate on it,
<del>you know,</del> days or weeks later.</p>
<p>As it is, the small injuries of all. ~~Um, ~~and I think, you know,
the, the question of, well, if he’s already at the patient already has
an infarct, would you like it? ~~Um, ~~I think that ~~ that
don’t,~~ that’s just not something that is a vascular surgeon, ~~um,
~~that, that I would pursue. I think, ~~um, um, I would try to, uh,
~~I would try to repair the injury reperfused the hemisphere.</p>
<p>~~Um, ~~acknowledged that, yes, you could make things worse with
reprofusion. but, ~~uh, ~~you also may take up a number that was
ischemic and you may reproduce it and, and push the penumbra in a
positive direction. So, you know, there’s not a lot of data in this
area. And I mentioned the word heroin. ~~Um, ~~you know, these are
the most challenging of, of injury scenarios for sure.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_krkniery_gmail.com.individual:</strong> Definitely. Yeah.
there’s no easy answers there,</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_usuhs.edu.individual:</strong> I mean,
what do you think, Nicole? What do you guys think and what’s your
experience? I mean, I, [00:41:00] I’m, I’m interested also in what you
guys think about that case.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_krkniery_gmail.com.individual:</strong> I have one
experience with this. It was in residency. ~~Um, ~~we had a, a
person that was sleeping and, ~~uh, ~~a, a pressure washer guy came
up to him and asked him to move. He refused to move and they got in a
fight and I got the pressure washer straight to the neck. ~~Uh,
~~tore open his carotid. They came into the ER holding pressure on his
neck and huge hemiparesis on the contralateral side.</p>
<p>~~Um, ~~in that case, we did repair the carotid, and he did have a
dense hemiparesis after the case. <del>Um, you know,</del> whether litigating
would have helped or not, you know, we don’t know, but that, that’s my,
that’s my one experience.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_host.individual:</strong> ~~Um, ~~I actually haven’t
seen a situation like this,</p>
<p>but it’s definitely a tough, it’s a tough situation. I think if you have
an injury that’s going to cause potential for bleeding or a pseudo
aneurysm. And the vessel is payment, then my [00:42:00] inclination
would be to repair it. <del>Um, if you’re doing,</del> if you have like an
occlusion of the artery, when you explore it, you know, say you try to
do a thrombectomy and you’re not getting any retrograde bleeding.</p>
<p>That might be a situation where I’ve considered ligating it, but these
are tough calls.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_usuhs.edu.individual:</strong> I think
you’re, I think you’re spot on. And I think as surgeons, you know,
at~~ you know, at some point, um, uh, you know, um, um, I won’t speak
for other of my colleagues. Uh, and I’m not saying that we. Try to teach
this mantra to our trainees. But you know,~~ sometimes what comes to
mind is, well, don’t overthink it. you’re a vascular surgeon.</p>
<p>You’ve explored a vascular injury. There’s a hole in the artery or
disrupted artery, do what we do, which is fix it. And, ~~um, ~~
again, I don’t mean to be, ~~um, uh, ~~overly simplistic. I’m not
trying to be, ~~um, uh, ~~sarcastic, but I, I think we get to that
point. Where you know you’re going to have to fix it.</p>
<p>It would be very difficult to just not do anything. And I think, ~~um,
~~in the case that you described Kevin, ~~um, ~~I think that’s
important. You do need to know going into these, that the outcome’s
going to be likely to be stroke. You know, whether you make the stroke
better or worse, ~~um, ~~you’re not [00:43:00] really going to know
by fixing the artery.</p>
<p>~~Um. ~~And so the outcome’s going to be pretty bad. ~~Uh,
~~either way, I think that’s important for family and the patients
and, for the care team to recognize. ~~Um, ~~these situations, but,
~~um, ~~to me fixing it as, unless Nicole, you bring up a good
point. If the carotids occluded, then yeah, I think then that is a time
when I would like eat it.</p>
<p>And I think this is where we fall back on our experience with carotid
endarterectomy and managing, you know, a string sign that we thought was
there from a carotid occlusive disease. And you explore the string sign.
And by the way, the carotid was occluded. In those cases, in a setting
of a carotid endarterectomy, we actually likely ligated.</p>
<p>~~Uh, ~~and so I think we fall back on some of the similar
principles that we pursue and we’re fixing age related carotid disease.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_krkniery_gmail.com.individual:</strong> Definitely,
~~uh, ~~and for completeness sake, there’s another large. That’s
hole in the neck, ~~uh, ~~that we encounter injuries to, ~~uh,
~~ what is your thought on, ~~uh, ~~internal jugular injuries?
~~Uh, ~~ can you like eight one, two, or</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_usuhs.edu.individual:</strong> Yeah, I
think, <del>uh, I mean, you certainly can.</del> [00:44:00] One can certainly,
~~um, uh, ~~like eight, these I think, ~~um, um, ~~and not have.
~~Um, ~~consequential effects in most patients. ~~Um, ~~
<del>internal carotid arteries that are, I’m sorry,</del> the internal jugular
veins that I have repaired have been in the situation of a significant
TBI.</p>
<p>So a patient has, ~~you know, um, uh, ~~bleeding in the neck. You
explore, explore the. the neck and the patient also has a penetrating
wound to the head and intracranial hypertension and, you know, needed a
decompressive craniectomy or something. in those cases, I have repaired
the internal jugular vein to maintain venous outflow of that side of the
brain.</p>
<p>~~Um, ~~you know, I’m never sure whether or not that is necessary,
but, ~~um, ~~you know, I think it, it makes sense to me. I think,
~~uh. ~~In one case, I remember before I repaired the internal
jugular vein, <del>you know,</del> we transduced a venous pressure, ~~uh,
~~towards the cranial side, and the venous pressure was, <del>you know,</del>
40 or 50 millimeters of mercury, and there was a gradient, right?</p>
<p>Eight millimeters of [00:45:00] mercury on the, on the cardiac side, or
the proximal or central side. So to me, if there’s a gradient, ~~um,
~~and the patient’s got a TBI. <del>Um, you know,</del> I think fixing it is
at least reasonable. but most of the time you can lie gate, ~~ the
external jugular, uh, ~~the internal juggler.</p>
<p>~~Um, ~~and there’s enough collateral, venous drainage that, ~~uh,
~~the patients will do fine.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_host.individual:</strong> Okay. So going back to repair
of the carotid artery and these, ~~uh, ~~trauma situations. So,
<del>you know,</del> we fall back on the standard steps that we use in, <del>um,
you know,</del> other types of vascular surgery. ~~Uh, ~~the first thing
being getting proximal and distal control. And then Dr. Rasmussen, can
you speak to us about heparin ization and how you manage that in the
trauma setting?</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_usuhs.edu.individual:</strong> Yeah. I
think this is, I’m in this injury pattern more than, ~~um, ~~more
than most or more than any other arterial injury pattern. You,
<del>you’ve,</del> you have to use heparin in these cases. ~~So, um, you
know, it’s a, uh, ~~ in some injury patterns, you kind of have to be
ready for a wild ride. Because because you explore the neck for bleeding
[00:46:00] in a, and if the patient has poly trauma, there’s bleeding
elsewhere.</p>
<p>~~Um, ~~and now you’re going to fix the carotid artery, ~~uh,
~~in some manner. You’re going to either put in a shunt or, or just
repair it primarily, or you’re going to have to, if you’re going to
clamp the carotid artery, ~~uh, ~~in my experience, you’re going to
need to use heparin. And so what I mean by a wild dried is, you know,
you’re.</p>
<p>Explore the patient for bleeding, they’re already bleeding. And now what
do you do? You give more heparin. ~~Um, ~~the key there is to try to
fix the carotid is, you know, as quickly as you can, ~~uh, ~~try to
manage the, the other areas of bleeding while the patients have denies.
~~Um, ~~and then, you know, bring them off of pepper and after the
carotid is repaired.</p>
<p>I think unlike, for example, I think there’s extremity arterial injuries
that can sometimes be managed without heparin. But I think if you’re
going to go to the trouble of, <del>uh, in the, in the, in</del> the technical,
~~um, ~~challenge of, fixing a traumatic carotid injury, ~~um,
~~I think in nearly [00:47:00] every case you got to give systemic,
~~uh, ~~heparin.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_krkniery_gmail.com.individual:</strong> so you know, you
have proximal and distal control. Now the patients have pronounced,
<del>um, and how,</del> how do you decide, ~~um, ~~whether to use a shunt
or not and what type of shot do you use.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_usuhs.edu.individual:</strong> <del>Yeah. So,
um, you know, so the tenants are not, and so</del> once you’ve done that,
the tenants are similar to other Cherrelle injuries. ~~Um, ~~ you
need to, ~~um, ~~identify the injury and then. Remove the burden of
thrombus. Often that can be done with flushing, you know, back bleeding
of the internal carotid or back blading and for bleeding.</p>
<p>And then, passage of a thrombectomy catheter, obviously passing a
thrombectomy catheter up. The internal carotid needs to be done. <del>Um,
you know,</del> very carefully. It’s usually a two or three Fogarty catheter
and just a centimeter two. You really don’t want to be putting a Fogarty
catheter. Distill into the internal carotid more than a centimeter too.</p>
<p>Hopefully you can rely on back bleeding, <del>you know, and back bleeding</del>
from that internal can quote unquote blow out any thrombus that’s there.
~~Um, ~~same with the proximal, but do [00:48:00] be aware that you
need to get rid of the thrombus burden in those arteries before you fix
them. ~~Um, ~~ whether or not to use a shunt, I mean, I think in
most cases of trauma, <del>um.</del></p>
<p><del>I, I have to say that</del> I do not use a shunt, ~~um, ~~because
~~it’s, it’s too, um, ~~it adds just another level of complexity to
a case that’s already complex. ~~Um, ~~and if I were to use a
Shaunte, I would use either an Argyle, Sean’s or a short son. Shant, S U
N D T. ~~Uh, ~~or the Argyle. Shawn’s. I think it’s reasonable to do
that.</p>
<p>~~Um, ~~let’s say you’ve got a long segment, ~~um, ~~the loss of
the carotid artery, you’re going to need to do an interposition graft,
let’s say. ~~Um, ~~and, and in that case, you, you know, you’re
going to have to go harvest vein. ~~Um, um, ~~you know, in those
cases, I suppose, sure. It’s, it’s reasonable in those cases to put in a
shunt to reproduce that hemisphere of the brain.</p>
<p>~~Uh, ~~while the conduit is, is harvested or prepared. ~~Um,
~~so certainly there are times when I have used a shunt in the setting
of trauma, but, <del>um, I always also,</del> I also try to keep in mind
[00:49:00] too, in the case of carotid trauma, to try to keep it as
simple as possible. Keep in mind, ~~um, ~~ That the internal carotid
can also be transposed over onto the external carotid artery as a
transposition.</p>
<p>You know, in some cases, depending upon the precise location of the
injury, so that, you know, you don’t need an interposition graft. And in
those cases, you know, you would not use a either. ~~Um. ~~So, <del>you
know, I think, yeah, be,</del> be mindful to use the shot and be ready, sort
of think about it, but also, ~~um, ~~if you find that fixing, it
sets up pretty quickly, either with an interposition graft or <del>with a
carotid transmission</del> transposing the internal onto the external.</p>
<p>If that sets up pretty quickly, ~~uh, ~~I do not think you should
feel obligated to use a shunt in the setting of trauma.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_host.individual:</strong> Okay. Great. ~~Um, ~~so.
Options for repair dictated somewhat by the injury and the size of the
injury. ~~Um, ~~you mentioned harvesting vein. ~~Um, ~~I think
that’s a good point, especially in cases where you’re [00:50:00]
exploring the neck and there’s also an aerodigestive injury, ~~um,
~~in order to avoid putting prosthetic in the vein option is nice.</p>
<p>~~Um, ~~what if you have a small injury and you’re just planning to
do a patch?</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_usuhs.edu.individual:</strong> So, For the
patch, I would either use, <del>uh, personally, I would use</del> Dacron or,
~~, um, uh, ~~bovine pericardium. <del>You know, I think something,
some prosthetic that’s available, uh, you know, hemophilia Dacron patch,
uh, or bovine pericardium, um, as a patch.</del> And I think, you know, you
raise a really good point there that I think if it’s, clearly a
contaminated wound.</p>
<p>A penetrating wound where, you know, whether it’s because there’s an
injury to the esophagus or the airway, or it’s a shotgun wound, and so
there’s a large soft tissue injury or a fragment wound that’s really
contaminated. Then I think in those cases, yes, I think efforts to
harvest vein sappiness Maine probably, are advised, <del>um.</del></p>
<p>I will say that if it’s the opposite of that, if it’s sort of a simple
penetrating wound, there’s no evidence, at least overt evidence of
aerodigestive injury. There’s no really other contamination. Let’s say
it’s a stab wound. ~~Uh, uh, ~~you know, and it’s not a big
[00:51:00] soft tissue all quickly, ~~uh, ~~also use, ~~uh, uh,
~~Dacron or PTFE and, or position graft and not use the, ~~um,
~~as I mentioned before, I think, <del>um.</del></p>
<p>You know, you try to be mindful of keeping these operations, <del>um, you
know,</del> as, as, ~~uh, ~~expeditious as possible. You try to move
them along. And, ~~um, ~~in the case where there’s not a lot of
contamination, ~~um, ~~or any contamination, ~~um, ~~I also will
then not use me. You know, I think, ~~uh, uh, ~~using a Dacron
interposition graft or PTFE in this larger vessel, these common carotid
is, <del>uh.</del></p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_host.individual:</strong> Okay, great. Then I think one
important point also to mention is that you need to debris back any
devitalized tissue. ~~Um, ~~so you know, if there’s a defect in the
artery, but the tissue around it is pretty ratty. You know, you may have
to actually debried it back and make the defect larger initially before
you repair it.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_usuhs.edu.individual:</strong> Really good
point. Yeah. This ma’am. And the same with us, Sean. That’s why. You
know, I said, be ready to use a shot. [00:52:00] Certainly in some
situations you need to use a shun, but you know, using the shot, you can
also, ~~uh, ~~either create <del>a concrete, you know,</del> an injury or
cause you to need to debris the artery back a little further.</p>
<p>~~Um, ~~so really good point.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_krkniery_gmail.com.individual:</strong> ~~Uh,
~~start, you’re asking some, one point that I picked up from reading
your chapter here is that, ~~uh, ~~we’re talking about back bleeding
from the internal carotid and it made the point of back bleeding is
restored. ~~Uh, ~~you should perform an interrupt angiogram. To
document complete evacuation of distal thrombus.</p>
<p>~~Um, ~~can you just speak to this.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_usuhs.edu.individual:</strong> Yeah. I
think, a completion study, ~~um. Um, ~~is is definitely, ~~uh,
<del>something to, consider or to perform. Now, I think we’ve used the,</del>
we’ve, we’ve used the~~ phrase during our discussion here this
afternoon, ~~uh, ~~a luxury. You know, there’s some of these things
that you have the luxury to do. You know, in some cases of trauma, you,
may not have the luxury to perform.</p>
<p>an on the table. Arteriogram so, ~~um, ~~in those cases, I would use
duplex, ~~uh, ~~if you have duplex or even, use ~~uh, ~~the,
[00:53:00] duplex function of, the ultrasound that you have in the, or
to show flow. ~~Um, ~~you know, and then the, the most simple thing
is a continuous wave Doppler.</p>
<p>And so some form of assessment of your repair certainly is indicated.
~~Um, ~~the complexity of that completion exam depends on what.
Capabilities you have and how the patient’s doing. ~~Um, ~~so
certainly in an ideal situation, you’re fully outfitted. You’ve got,
~~uh, ~~ experienced colleague or partner or fellow with you, and,
~~um, ~~you know, the patient is on the right imaging table and you
can do a completion arteriogram then absolutely.</p>
<p>I would, ~~uh, ~~ put a, 18 gauge butterfly in the common carotid
artery. Make sure it’s. The aired so that you don’t inject air and shoot
a completion arteriogram, ~~uh, ~~both the repair and the distal
internal carotid to assure that there’s no thrombus in situations where
you’re not that outfitted and you don’t have that luxury then using a
duplex ultrasound.</p>
<p>~~Um, ~~ I think is, [00:54:00] is fine. And in those cases, you
don’t have duplex or the patients just, ~~uh. Uh, ~~has enough
injuries that are in his, in a complicated enough situation using a
continuous wave Doppler and, and, and just, finishing up is also</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_host.individual:</strong> I’m curious. Dr. Rasmussen, do
you use a completion imaging study for elective carotid repairs?</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_usuhs.edu.individual:</strong> At this
point? ~~Um, ~~yeah, we use, ~~uh, ~~ultrasound. We use duplex
ultrasound, but not arteriography. I mean, I think that the
arteriography point is, ~~uh, ~~ is useful. I appreciate that. And,
~~uh, ~~I think, for those who have done that before and are used to
doing it, it’s reasonable. The, the counter to that would be, well,
let’s say you see a little bit of thrombus. in the distal internal,
beyond your room repair, what are you going to do about it? so it, it’s
not to make light of or diminish the need for, confirming a technically
adequate or perfect repair. but I think, [00:55:00] to some of my
previous comments, you know, we as surgeons, I think, try to strike this
balance between, <del>I mean, um.</del></p>
<p><del>You know,</del> being perfect and then spending too much time overthinking
it and, ~~uh, uh, ~~carotid ~~angiography ~~completion
angiography in the setting of trauma may just not be feasible in a lot
of cases. ~~Um, ~~or people may not have the experience in doing it.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_host.individual:</strong> Right. Okay, so what if there’s
a concomitant tracheal or esophageal injury? Do you do anything</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_usuhs.edu.individual:</strong> Well, I
mean, I think we, we didn’t mention the word, we didn’t mention drains.
So, you know, in all of these cases where we’ve explored his own to
penetrate a neck injury, those patients are all drained. ~~Uh,
~~with, ~~uh, ~~you know, for me, ~~uh, uh, ~~a seven
millimeter flat JP drain or, or maybe more, ~~um, ~~I guess that’s a
great question.</p>
<p>I don’t know that there’s a situation where I really buttressed ~~uh,
~~or done used any adjuncts [00:56:00] to cover my repair. ~~Um,
~~ the vascularity of the neck. ~~Um, um. ~~ is good and if not,
great. And I think that helps. I think if you’ve drained <del>the, uh, the,
uh, the,</del> the wound that is also sort of a mitigating step.</p>
<p>And I’m not sure that I have buttressed, ~~uh, ~~or done anything,
~~um, ~~more than that to protect the arterial repair. And maybe
it’s because I’ve not had any that have had. overt esophageal injury.
They may be, you know, micro injury or something like that. Small. do
you think, Nicole?</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_host.individual:</strong> I’ve heard of using a muscle
flap to separate the. Esophageal injury from the arterial injury, but
I’m not sure if that’s always necessary. And I do like the idea of the
drain, because that would prevent any</p>
<p>collection from building up there that could compromise your</p>
<p>arterial repair.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_usuhs.edu.individual:</strong> I think
that those are both. Good points. I think the drain is in my mind, the
drains of mosque. Even if you explore the zone too. Yeah. You still
know, [00:57:00] because remember many of this opera deal injury, you
just not going to see, and honestly. I don’t know that any of us are
familiar enough with exposing the esophagus, ~~uh, ~~through that
wound, we, we may sort of see the esophagus, and do the best we can, but
many of this off the GL injuries will be pretty small, ~~um, ~~or we
may not see them.</p>
<p>~~Uh, ~~so I think that, ~~uh, ~~the drain is a must, ~~uh,
~~ in these injuries, at least one and a muscle flap, I guess is
something to consider if there’s gross contamination. You know, either
spillage from a softened geo wound or they’re just gross contamination,
the wound.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_krkniery_gmail.com.individual:</strong> Well, Dr.
Rasmussen, once again, ~~uh. ~~We’ve covered a lot of topics in one
session and we really appreciate your expertise and insight</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_todd.rasmussen_usuhs.edu.individual:</strong> Well, it’s
a pleasure to, to have the discussion with you this afternoon, and,
~~um, ~~and I hope that it’s useful to, to you and to your
listeners. I know it’s been useful for me to run through a lot of these
scenarios with you this afternoon, so [00:58:00] thanks for the
opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>ringr_116213_115337_krkniery_gmail.com.individual:</strong> And I think we
still have at least one more topic to cover in the future. endovascular
slash were boa management of trauma, if you’re up for it.</p>

<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> [00:00:00] Welcome back to behind the knife and
audible bleedings vascular trauma podcast series with Dr. Todd
Rasmussen. Today are in our final episode. We’re going to discuss the
endovascular management of acute vascular injury specifically. We’re
going to focus on. Thoracic~~ , uh,~~ blunt aortic injury and
endovascular treatment options for EXITO subclavian injuries.</p>
<p>~~Um, ~~today we’re lucky enough to have Dr. Todd Rasmussen. He’s a
Colonel United States air force and his professor of surgery and an
associate Dean of research at the uniform services. University of health
sciences is an attending vascular surgeon at Walter Reed national
military medical center. Welcome back Dr.</p>
<p>Rasmussen.</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> Thanks very much. ~~Uh, ~~Kevin for the
opportunity I look forward to. A good discussion ~~on a, ~~on a, I
think a really important topic. Thank you. Great.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> [00:01:00] And~~ , uh,~~ we also have Dr. Wayne
Kasi. He’s the chief of vascular surgery at San Antonio military medical
center at a level one trauma center in San Antonio, Texas.</p>
<p>And he’s an associate professor of surgery at the uniformed services,
university of health sciences. So a welcome,</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> thanks, Kevin.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> All right~~ , well,~~ let’s just dive in. We’re
going to focus first on the blunt, thoracic aortic injury and the
endovascular management of that. So I think it’s important to
understand.</p>
<p>how this occurs and what patients is occurs in. So blunt, thoracic Edric
injury is rare, but it’s very lethal. It’s less than 1% of all blunt
traumas, but it’s the second leading cause of death in blunt trauma.</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> Yes, Kevin, that’s why whenever I’m called about a
patient who has a blunt aortic injury.</p>
<p>I really want to know what their other injuries are because these are
usually very high velocity mechanism injuries, and there’s a particular
concern that they’ll have an intracranial injury.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> Right. So,~~ you know, <del>when you’re the trauma
resident</del> , uh,~~ taking pages, ~~you know, <del>the things you want
to think about, that’ll clue you into</del> , uh, you know, ~~we need to
make sure they don’t have this as a high-speed motor [00:02:00] vehicle
collisions, motorcycle crashes vehicle versus pedestrians and falls from
Heights are some of the most common causes of blunt, thoracic aortic
injury.</p>
<p>Yeah, I</p>
<p>think</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> it’s most vascular surgeons have seen. It’s pretty
amazing. Now the types of injuries people can survive. ~~I mean,
~~I’ve seen people in cars who <del>fallen over overpass,</del> fallen off of
overpasses people being hit by trains, the prehospital management and
the vehicle safety features that exist now have really expanded what
survivable.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> ~~ Yeah. And , um, yeah. ~~Quickly, we’re going to
just ~~kind of ~~review some of the anatomy of where these injuries
occur ~~is. Um, ~~so the aortic arch itself is relatively mobile. It
doesn’t have a lot of tethering, but the descending thoracic aorta
itself is actually ~~kind of ~~tethered. And ~~so , uh, it’s
<del>it’s at that junction just distal</del> , uh,~~ to the.</p>
<p>Subclavian artery~~ , um,~~ is where these injuries generally occur.
Most of them curved within about a half centimeter to two centimeters of
the left subclavian artery. And so it’s at that junction that~~ ,
uh,~~ that the aorta tears due to the deceleration. ~~Um, ~~so
Wayne, do you have any particular thoughts on the diagnostic methods for
these?[00:03:00]</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> ~~Well, <del>I think most trauma centers have a pretty
good protocol, such as the level one trauma center we work at. Typically
the patients who come in with a really high velocity mechanism, injury,
get a CT angiogram of the chest, abdomen and pelvis. And oftentimes if
there’s an extremity that’s injured as well, that’ll just be carried
down through the</del> , uh,~~ lower extremities as well, or the upper
extremities.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> Yeah. Great. So yeah, CTA~~ , um,~~ is critical in
these patients~~ , um,~~ to help~~ , uh,~~ diagnose this. And so
it’s important to realize that~~ , uh,~~ patients with these
injuries, the majority of them greater than 75% never make it to the
hospital. ~~Um, ~~and those that do make it, the hospital are likely
~~going ~~to be severely injured and in multiple other ways.</p>
<p>And it’s not gonna be an isolated injury. ~~Um, <del>so quickly, we’re
just gonna go over the SVS grading system. There’s a couple of ways to
grade these. The current one in the SVS is</del> , uh,~~ has four grades.
The first one is a grade one, intimal tear. Grade two is an intramural
hematoma. Grade three is a pseudo aneurysm.</p>
<p>So there’s an actual contour of the aorta is [00:04:00] disrupted. <del>And
, uh,</del> and then grade four is what they consider rupture. So those are
the four SVS grading systems and~~ , um,~~ When do you want to talk
a little bit about how Dr. Starnes ~~kind of ~~breaks it down? Yes,</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> Kevin that’s the official grading system. I remember
when behind the knife first started~~ , uh,~~ one of the first or
second episodes was an interview with Dr.</p>
<p>Ben Starnes. And I remember listening to his blunt, thoracic aortic
injury recommendations on the way to the hospital, as I would consult on
one of these blunt, thoracic aortic injuries. And he really categorize
these into three different categories based on his Harbor view data.
~~Uh, <del>that was a minimal aortic injury</del> , uh,~~ which had a 10
millimeter or less intimal tear, a moderate, which had a pseudo
aneurysm.</p>
<p>And then the maximal, which I think he summed up very well and saying
that there was a unilateral, hemothorax active contrast. Extravasation a
periodic hematoma greater than two centimeters in maximum width. And
those were the patients that needed to go to the operating room,
basically at the time of the consult.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> Yeah. Yeah, that’s a great point. So ~~the,
~~[00:05:00] the Dr. Star and slash Harbor view categorization is
really just three categories and they ~~kind of ~~depend on when you
operate. So the minimal ones you don’t operate on. Those are just the
intimal tears, the moderate ones. They need an operation, but not
emergently.</p>
<p>And the Maximo ones need a, an emergent operation. And so I think that
was part of his ~~kind of ~~reasoning for it. One of the things</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> that. Struck me with that podcast on behind the knife
was he mentioned that what’s the point of having a grading system that.
Doesn’t have a treatment with each different grade.</p>
<p>And so as Kevin goes through these, you’ll see that there’s a little bit
of overlap between the two grades. And the point of that previous
podcast was if you’re going to have three treatments, then you need to,
which is imaging or surveillance~~ , uh,~~ delayed repair, and then
urgent, emergent, or urgent repair.</p>
<p>Then there needs to be three different grading scores,</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> right? Yeah. Yeah. ~~I think, <del>I think Dr.
Starnes in that</del> , uh, the ~~grading system, you mentioned, I always
find it to be ~~sort of ~~[00:06:00] practical, <del>um , uh,</del> it’s
very practical, <del>uh , for,</del> for us. <del>Um , the,</del> the four category
classification ~~is, <del>is a little bit more technical and maybe a
little less practical, but</del> , um,~~ yeah, I agree.</p>
<p>I think it’s~~ , uh,~~ That’s true. ~~You know, ~~the other
thing before we get too far into this, I do think it’s useful for your
listeners. <del>Um , uh,</del> Kevin T there, there’s a couple of classic,
~~uh , um, you know, <del>papers</del> , uh,~~ on. Blunt aortic injury
<del>and , and,</del> and they really speak to, for those who are interested in
vascular trauma, interested in this condition, I would ch I would
encourage you to dig into just two or three papers.</p>
<p>One of them is the original double AST paper led by Dr. Dimitrios and
the team at LA County in the late 1990s. ~~Um, ~~on blunt aortic
injury, which not surprisingly in the late 1990s, that double AST, what
we refer to as the WST one study showed that nearly all a blenny already
injuries were fixed with an open thoracotomy and clamping and sewing
into graft.</p>
<p>~~Um, <del>the WST [00:07:00] repeated that study about 10 years later
and in 2006</del> , Uh,~~ or so I think it was actually published in
2008~~ , um, where they , uh, double~~ it’s called the double AST
two study. <del>So in the journal,</del> both of these were in the journal of
trauma at the time. Now it’s the journal of trauma and acute care
surgery.</p>
<p>Again, led by Dr. Dimitrios says, <del>um , and,</del> and in that 10 year
period, the management of blood aortic injury had completely. ~~Uh,
<del>evolved from open repair to end a repair. And we won’t go into the
details of those studies, but</del> , um, you know, and ~~then you go
three or four years later, and now there’s the SBS that’s writing these
guidelines.</p>
<p>So which you’ve seen in those three papers, the WST one in 1998 or nine
was T2. In 2008, both in the journal of trauma. And now the leading
organization writing the guidelines is the SBS and not the WST. What you
see there is this evolution ~~of, ~~of the management of this, <del>uh
, this,</del> injury pattern from open, ~~you know, ~~to [00:08:00]
nearly exclusively endo now.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> Yeah, that is a fascinating evolution. ~~Um, ~~and
very interesting. ~~I, I ~~I’ve heard of those papers, but I didn’t
realize the transition from ~~the, ~~the trauma journal to the
vascular journal for the kind of guidelines on it. ~~Um, ~~</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> surprisingly again~~ , um,~~ at the risk of you
guys not inviting me back, I don’t mean to monopolize the conversation,
but~~ , um, you know, ~~the thing that’s happened with that
evolution is the mortality, the survival ~~of, ~~of operating on
~~these, ~~these injuries has improved.</p>
<p>Rates of paraplegia have decreased blood utilization is decreased. <del>You
know , patients,</del> patients have a better chance in 2020 than they did
in 2000, ~~you know, <del>and it’s largely because of the evolution to
endo</del> , uh,~~ technologies that we’ve. We’ve mentioned, and I</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> bet there’s not a whole lot of other specific things
in trauma that have had that big of a change or improvement in outcomes
in that amount of time.</p>
<p>So it’s pretty, it’s actually pretty special kind of a pathology and
improvement there.</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> Yes, sir. I [00:09:00] encourage one of your
listeners to write that up. It’d be a great review. ~~Uh, you know,
<del>two decade review</del> , uh,~~ two and a half decade review ~~of,
~~of just the broad strokes, how that practice has changed and how
paraplegia rates are down on mortality rates.</p>
<p>It’s still a highly lethal injury, but if patients make it to the
hospital, as you were referring to~~ , um,~~ modern grading, modern
management techniques, give them a much better chance.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> Absolutely. ~~And I, ~~and I’ll include all those
papers in the show notes. So you can just go click the links in the show
notes here.</p>
<p>~~Um, ~~we’re going to get back into the <del>kind of</del> management of
this. ~~Um, ~~there’s some things that all of these patients are
going to need, whether they’re going to get surgery or not. ~~Um,
~~you really want to focus on anti impulse therapy. And generally you
can do it with a beta blockade and a short acting beta blocker is the
best.</p>
<p>~~Um, ~~so that’s going to be as small as generally ~~the, ~~the
BA the beta blocker of choice. And of course you have to talk with your
neurosurgery colleagues. ~~Um, ~~and we’re gonna discuss a little
bit this more lately, but. ~~Um, you know, ~~generally want the
blood pressure less than 120 systolic. ~~Um, ~~it’s, there’s no
guidelines on that, but it’s just sort of consensus ~~of, ~~of
surgeons.</p>
<p>But, ~~you know, ~~[00:10:00] obviously it depends on their head
injury and other what other issues they have going on. ~~Um, <del>and
generally</del> , uh,~~ As far as, ~~you know, <del>managing this small
tears, the less than 10 millimeter ones</del> , uh,~~ the guidelines
recommend a CTA within 30 days. If you have a larger flap, greater than
10 millimeters, this is something you’re going to image sooner.</p>
<p>~~Uh, ~~generally within seven days. And as Dr. Kazi pointed out the
other day is that many of these patients are getting rescanned for lots
of different things. Reasons, whether it’s their <del>blood organ , uh,</del>
solid organ injuries and other things, and really ~~kind of ~~try
and work it into one of those or ~~kind of <del>fit the imaging</del> ,
um,~~ to help them out.</p>
<p>And then~~ , um, if it’s an in,~~ we’re gonna talk a little more
about this in detail, but if there is an external aortic contour
abnormality, generally, you’re going to repair that within less than one
week. And then of course, if the patient is hypotensive and has a
hematoma~~ , um,~~ concerning for a rupture, this should be repaired
urgently.</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> One of the things that comes up often I find is that.
Patients <del>who ha</del> who need to have their blood pressure elevated for
one reason or another such as a traumatic brain injury. And if you go
back on the behind the knife conversation~~ , um,~~ a couple of
years ago, this [00:11:00] was really brought to life as if they need to
ramp up the blood pressure to treat intracranial pathology.</p>
<p>Oftentimes that’s going to require a very urgent repair~~ , um,~~ so
that, that blood pressure can be brought up because you will not be able
to do that anti impulse therapy.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> Dark there. Are you saying <del>on the,</del> if there is a
grade one injury~~ , um,~~ per <del>the say either,</del> either
guidelines, the Starns or the SPS guidelines~~ , uh, that you would
this, if,~~ and they needed a high blood pressure for their brain,
you’d potentially~~ , uh,~~ repair it with a T VAR.</p>
<p>~~Uh, ~~even though there is no pseudo aneurysm.</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> That’s a great question. I think that Dr. Starnes
covered that a little bit and I’m not gonna speak too much on what he
said, but he found that the intimal terrors at 30 days in that podcast,
that they were not going to need to be re-imaged or repaired at all.</p>
<p>And so he put each of those patients on 325 milligrams of aspirin for 30
days and said in that podcast that he didn’t Ramage them. So in that
particular case, no, I would not repair an intimal. Tear. ~~Um,
~~but if it was a [00:12:00] significant other type of aortic injury,
I think I would lean towards repairing that.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts, Dr. Rasmussen?</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> Yeah~~ , I,~~ I agree. I think that~~ , um,
you know, ~~the, sort of the grade ones that, <del>uh , the,</del> the~~ ,
um,~~ Seattle group has described, <del>um , I,</del> I, I don’t think that
they~~ , um, You know, ~~parsed out the patients who might, for
example, need a higher cerebral profusion pressure. And therefore
~~they, <del>they’re not as amenable to</del> , uh, you know, ~~anti
impulse therapy or hypotensive, resuscitation, whatever.</p>
<p>I don’t think they really parse that out, but <del>I don’t. I also don’t.</del>
I also don’t think that they, <del>you know, they th th that they</del>
recommend or others around the country recommend, <del>you know , um,</del>
Fixing grade one injuries ~~in, ~~in those patients. I think that
they’re, if they’re grade one ~~ , Um, they, you know , those,~~
those generally don’t need to be treated.</p>
<p>And~~ , uh,~~ now, ~~I mean, ~~I think there’s always room as in
all of these complex situations for, <del>um , for,</del> for another CT, <del>you
know , for,</del> for a followup CT to see, ~~I mean, <del>if</del> , uh,~~ if
a provider’s really nervous about it and~~ , uh, you know, ~~the.
The neurosurgeons have had to drive up the pressure for the [00:13:00]
TBI or, <del>uh , to,</del> to maintain, <del>uh , uh,</del> CPP ~~then, <del>then</del> ,
um, you know, ~~you can always image them again to confirm that.</p>
<p>But~~ , uh,~~ I agree. I think ~~if, <del>if they’re a grade one
injury</del> , um,~~ right now ~~they, they, you know, non
~~non-operative therapies is safe and indicated.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> Great. So let’s talk a little bit more about the nitty
gritty of actually repairing these things. It’s important for~~ ,
uh,~~ residents out there to understand~~ , uh,~~ the T-bar
devices that are currently in the market.</p>
<p>~~Um, ~~these are generally designed for aneurysmal disease and not
for the trauma population. ~~Uh, <del>the Trump populations going to be
smaller. They’re going to be</del> , um,~~ Younger and healthier vessels
and ~~it’s , um, you know, ~~these devices weren’t really made. So
the devices that we currently have, they are, ~~you know, <del>generally
require large diameter</del> , uh,~~ access.</p>
<p>Their compliance is not~~ , uh,~~ as ideal for these <del>kinds of ,
uh,</del> smaller aortic arches. And the actual size of the devices are
relatively large compared to these aortas. ~~Um, ~~the average size
of the aorta proximal to the injury in a study was shown to be about 19
millimeters. And our current smallest [00:14:00] device is about 22
millimeters, which is, ~~you know, an ~~adequate oversizing, but you
~~wouldn’t, you know, that’s , uh, only, you know, ~~wouldn’t want
much bigger than that.</p>
<p><del>So , uh,</del> Dr. W what is your experience with the current generation
of devices?</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> Yeah, I think the good news for a lot of these devices
is that the technology seems to be advancing. To where arch confirmation
is starting to have a lot of technological advances so that the young
patient with the steep aortic arch will better be treated in the coming
decade.</p>
<p>Dr. Rasmussen, this always brings up an interesting question in regards
to, so the sizing of an Intergraph, so in a patient’s injured and
they’re in the trauma Bay and they get their CT angiogram. Oftentimes
they’re under resuscitated. How do you go about assessing what you think
is the proper size of the order and choosing your endograft.</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> So I think ~~ , um,~~ it’s a great question.
And~~ , um,~~ one of the things just to add to ~~what you’ve,
<del>what you’ve said</del> , uh,~~ Wayne is that~~ , um,~~ and it
really, I think fits with our~~ , um,~~ the, ~~you know, ~~the
line of our discussion about the evolution of, <del>uh , of,</del> of, not of
this injury pattern. Now our ability to [00:15:00] have classifications
that are pretty technical~~ , uh,~~ with degree of injury.</p>
<p>~~Um, ~~and then the evolution of. Of management techniques is now
the evolution of these stent graphs. And, <del>you know , um,</del> one of
the,~~ I think~~ things to keep in mind is that. TEVAR for blunt
<del>threat , um,</del> thoracic endovascular, aneurysm repair T VAR extent
graft~~ , uh,~~ for blunt aortic injury, ~~you know, ~~a decade
ago was done with really very clunky endograft technology <del>and none of
that technology.</del></p>
<p><del>Let’s say for the,</del> for example, the WST two study that I cited~~ ,
uh, the , the,~~ the endovascular repairs in that study were often~~
, uh, you know, <del>iliac limbs</del> , uh, for the, you know, ~~not really
designed ~~for, <del>for blunt aortic injury. Now, fast forward to 2020.
And we have, for example</del> , uh,~~ one of the devices that is made by
Gore is actually has an indication~~ , uh,~~ for~~ , uh,~~ an
aortic transduction.</p>
<p>~~You know, <del>and so now</del> , uh, you know , the,~~ the
technology~~ , uh,~~ is really evolved now ~~to, ~~to suit the,
~~you know, ~~the condition, which is ~~sort of ~~exciting. And
I think gives us as vascular [00:16:00] surgeons ~~and, ~~and gives
patients a lot better options. ~~Um, <del>maybe we can go over some of
the specific devices</del> , uh,~~ next, your point, or your question
about~~ , um, you know, ~~imaging is, I think ~~is, ~~is.</p>
<p>Is an important one for listeners to understand. And I think ~~w
~~just to be clear, what we’re talking about ~~is <del>is that if</del> ,
uh,~~ if~~ , uh,~~ Patient’s aorta is imaged in the cat scanner
when his or her systolic blood pressure is 90 and they’re relatively
hypovolemic then, <del>you know , is, is the , uh,</del> how accurate is it has
a diameter of 18 millimeters, for example.</p>
<p>And is that a vasoconstrictive or just a hypovolemic~~ , uh,~~
aorta. And I think it is, I think that ~~it is, it is, <del>it is not the
greatest</del> , uh,~~ measure and that providers should~~ , um,~~ To
keep that in mind that when patients are resuscitated, that the diameter
of the aorta is actually going to be larger. So usually what I would
recommend is to~~ , um, you know, ~~still oversize, <del>uh , the,</del>
the stent graft by, ~~you know, <del>20% or so based on your original
measurement</del> , uh,~~ again and here~~ , uh,~~ unlike aneurysm
disease [00:17:00] where~~ , um, you know, ~~you’re trying to.</p>
<p>I think get a seal and it really diseased~~ , um,~~ and dilated
aorta here. <del>Uh, you know, the seals zone in, in the, in</del> the
pathology ~~is, ~~is almost always much more focal. You’re really
just trying to cover and seal the proximal intimal tear. ~~Um, ~~and
so I think that, ~~you know, <del>oversizing by roughly 20%</del> , um,~~
Using intravascular ultrasound or IVUS, I think is also useful.</p>
<p>Sometimes when you get them, the patient to the, or for the TVR, for the
thoracic endovascular repair, using intravascular ultrasound real time
to confirm or refute your original~~ , um, you know, your original~~
CT scan is. Is~~ , uh,~~ is also useful. ~~Um, ~~but I think
keeping in mind the blood pressure and their volume status when the scan
was taken oversizing by somewhere around 20 to 25% and then using IVIS.</p>
<p>So I think are useful tips. What do you think, or how do you guys do it
in San Antonio? Oh, that’s a</p>
<p>great</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> point. <del>I mean , we,</del> we set up IVUS for every
single aortic case so that it can be there. It’s mounted to the system
and. [00:18:00] Even if we don’t use it for the particular case, we know
that everything’s there and available for us to use it.</p>
<p>If we need to re image or resize and aorta or some other blood vessels
so that it can be adequately sized. I remember one time we had a 17 year
old with a blunt traumatic aortic injury and he needed an emergent
repair and we didn’t have the smallest endograft at the hospital, but
fortunately there was a one from a local hospital that could be sent
over, but.</p>
<p>That was a little bit of a troubleshooting. I was, what is, what was I
going to do as far as putting a larger endograft into a relatively
smaller we’re to knowing exactly what we talked about that open repair
has much worse outcomes than an endovascular repair. And I think my, the
way I was going to approach that one was I was going to use the IVIS
after I deployed the endograft to make sure I didn’t have a retrograde
dissection~~ , uh, ~~or <del>something , uh,</del> some major complication
related to the procedure.</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> Yeah, ~~I think, <del>I think that also</del> , uh,~~
Wayne speaks to the, <del>um , um,</del> the, <del>um , in,</del> in some ways, and
~~I, <del>I don’t want this [00:19:00] to be not, I don’t want to
overstate this, but in some ways this condition is</del> , um,~~ although
the overall patient complexity can be a much greater, some ways, just
the aortic. Pathology is simpler ~~than, ~~than a complex dilated
aortic aneurysm and in an elderly patient.</p>
<p>~~And, ~~and I think that makes it more amenable to, ~~um , Uh, to
, um, you know, sort of ~~belts and suspenders repair, meaning that
you just really need to seal ~~the, ~~the entry point. ~~I mean,
<del>again, it’s not, I’m not trying to oversimplify it because it is
serious. And these certainly</del> , uh,~~ some of these, a grade three or
four by imaging can certainly rupture and cause mortality.</p>
<p>~~But, <del>but even in the WST two trial in 2000, Eight that was
published in the journal of trauma, the success and the, in the
unmistakable</del> , uh,~~ advantage of endo repair over open. That was
all using very primitive, endo materials, ~~you know, ~~as I
mentioned ~~ , so, you know, I think, um , uh,~~ it’s really an
exciting part of vascular~~ , uh,~~ practice mascular [00:20:00]
trauma ~~is, <del>is the evolution of</del> , uh,~~ of these technologies.</p>
<p>But~~ , uh,~~ I appreciate, and I agree with, and it definitely used
them. Belts and suspenders sorts of endograft that you got. It’s not
exactly the one you want. ~~Um, ~~but you use what you can and just
try to seal ~~the, ~~the proximal portion of the intimal tear.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> Yeah. And~~ , uh, you know, <del>there, there’s a lot
of technical aspects of these and</del> , uh, kind of , uh,~~ you can
miss~~ , um,~~ the zone you can deploy to proximal, to distal.</p>
<p>One of the issues that comes up and you see ~~sort of <del>in a case
reports of</del> , uh, you know, <del>malpositioned</del> , uh,~~ devices is what
they call bird beaking and where the~~ , um, the lesser curve,~~ the
graft isn’t. Approximated well~~ , um,~~ to the lesser curve of the
aorta and a doctor asked me, said, I wonder if you had any tips for our
listeners~~ , um,~~ on how to avoid a bird beak.</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> Yeah. Great question. A couple of things. ~~Um,
<del>so I wish we could</del> , uh,~~ illustrate this~~ , uh,~~ for your
listeners. ~~Um, <del>you did a nice job bird beaking to me and</del> , uh,
you know, <del>you guys jump in or correct me if you’ve got a different way
to articulate it. On just [00:21:00] a call. We don’t have a
whiteboard</del> , um,~~ bird beaking, as you said, is the, is ~~sort of
~~the lifting of the inferior aspect of the very proximal.</p>
<p>~~Uh, ~~endograft where the fabric is. ~~That that, ~~that ring,
if you will, of stent covered stent lifts up off of the inner curve of
the aortic arch. And if it lifts up, then it’s prone to get ~~an, a,
you know, ~~the jet of flow and pressure that then, ~~you know,
<del>would cause an endo leak. And so to get that first covered stent ring
to lay down</del> , uh,~~ so that it doesn’t lift up and cause this, I
guess the bird beat comes, cause it ~~sort of ~~has this appearance
of a.</p>
<p>I’m a triangle~~ , uh, on the, ~~on the imaging, I guess that’s
where bird big comes from. ~~Um, <del>to get that, to lay down a couple
of things, one</del> , um,~~ I think getting a stiff wire~~ , um, uh ,
uh,~~ around the outer edge of the art. So using an Amplatz~~ ,
uh,~~ or a lender, Quist wire, that’s really~~ , um,~~ all the way
into the aortic root, the ascending aorta and actually [00:22:00]
pushing it.</p>
<p>~~Um, ~~so that it’s got ~~sort of <del>a constant. Tension that</del> ,
um,~~ allows you to get the endograft forward and, ~~you know,
~~making sure that you have a stiff wire and platform. Is one, <del>you
know , that’s,</del> that’s a basic principle of endograft deployment
anyway, independent of the bird beak. But I think that helps. And
then~~ I think another is to consider if there’s,~~ if it’s close or
if it’s an angulated arch to consider taking the endograft over, across
the origin of the left subclavian artery~~ , um, to where the , um,
You know, ~~to where the there’s more room, if you will, and a flatter
inner arch or inferior aspect of that curvature to lay the graph down.</p>
<p>So covering the left subclavian, using a stiff wire with forward
pressure on that wire during positioning and deployment. And then the
third thing, ~~you know, some of the, <del>the Gore</del> , uh,~~
conformable~~ , uh,~~ Thoracic Intergraph now actually has a kind of
a ratchet on it that, that allows one to have some control of that first
stent so that you can actually ~~kind of ~~conform or lay it down.</p>
<p>~~Um, ~~I think ~~that ~~that’s real. ~~Um, ~~[00:23:00] I’m
not quite sure how effective, I don’t know what, ~~you know, <del>Wayne,
what you think about the conformable Gore graft, but I think that maybe
another advantage that comes as graphs that you can actually. Manipulate
them when they’re in place and try to lay down that first</del> , uh,~~
covered stent component.</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> ~~Right? I, ~~I think that’s ideal. ~~I mean,
~~we have recently. Switched all our inventory. So we let the old
stuff, ~~you know, ~~use it ~~or, <del>or expire. And then everything
that we purchased now for blunt, thoracic aortic injury is conformable.
And I like to use the double curve Lundquist. And just like you said, I.
I have the assistant</del> , uh,~~ whoever’s holding the wire actually put
forward pressure.</p>
<p>So that, that wire is really snugged against the greater curvature of
the ~~order ~~aorta. And also that the double curve lender request
is basically sitting <del>at the , uh,</del> at the heart so that it can really
give me as much tension as I can. And I think that bringing it across
less of cleaving, if you think it’s going to be bird beak ~~is,
~~[00:24:00] is.</p>
<p>Absolutely essential that if you need to cover it so that you don’t have
it sitting oddly on the inner curvature, ~~that ~~that’s ideal. And
I agree with you a hundred percent.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> Yeah. <del>So , uh,</del> another kind of issue~~ , uh,~~
that we can sometimes run into in our trauma patients is getting the
devices there. ~~Um, <del>some of the iliac arteries are</del> , uh,~~
relatively small.</p>
<p>~~Um, you know, <del>granted the devices are getting smaller themselves,
but Dr. Rasmussen, do you have a size</del> , uh,~~ that you would
consider doing an Elliot conduit~~ , uh,~~ for these graphs? Is
there ~~kind of ~~a rule of thumb with our current generation?</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> That’s a great idea. A great question. A great idea.
Sometimes to do it in Elliot conduit, if you need it.</p>
<p>I think~~ , um,~~ Boy, I hate to~~ , uh,~~ to wimp out and just
say it depends. ~~Um, so I would say that, you know, if , if, if the
iliac , um, but it does, <del>but it does depend</del> , um, you know, ~~it
depends on the age of the patient. ~~I mean, <del>if they’re calcium
free</del> , um, you know, <del>it’s a young patient, like many or most of our
trauma patients</del> , um,~~ and the iliac is, <del>you know , um,</del> Seven
millimeters or greater.</p>
<p>~~Um, ~~and it’s ~~sort of ~~a straight shot we’ll give it a
try. seven. [00:25:00] To eight millimeters is ~~sort of ~~on the
small side of this. ~~Um, but I will often, ~~but if it’s calcium
free ~~in, ~~in a young patient, then, ~~you know, w w ~~we’ll
try it <del>through the, through , uh,</del> through the femoral without a
conduit.</p>
<p>~~Um, ~~I think that if gets smaller than that, if it’s a female and
they’re hypotensive, when the images come through and ~~you, you know,
~~you’re ultrasounding them in the, or using duplex to size up their
common femoral and ~~you, you know, ~~whether it’s shock or just
they’re native, they’re just small. If it gets to be, ~~you know,
<del>less than six or seven millimeters, then I think</del> , uh, You know ,
uh,~~ exposing either the common femoral or the external iliac through
retroparotoneil approach and putting on a Dacron conduit is it’s easy
enough ~~ , uh,~~ and should be done.</p>
<p>~~Um, ~~So it depends, but ~~you know, ~~the flip side, <del>I
guess , uh,</del> Kevin is that ~~if it’s , uh, you know, ~~if there’s a
lot of calcium and it’s an elderly patient and it looks like there’s
atherosclerosis, then I have a lower threshold to put on a conduit
because ~~you know, ~~you could cause problems. It’s not as
accommodating of a passage of the sheet.</p>
<p>~~If they’re, ~~if they’re calcified or [00:26:00] highly</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> ambulant, Yeah, I think if it measures seven on the
seat, the angiogram and the trauma Bay, that it’s likely, like you said,
if it’s not calcified and not diseased and not injured, otherwise
~~it’s, ~~it’s a good chance that you’re gonna be able to deliver
that endograft without any difficulty.</p>
<p>~~Um, ~~you may, I sometimes consider, I use do a most
percutaneously, but cut down on the femoral artery, just like you said,
just to make sure that it’s delivered safely. And if there’s a problem
with removing it, that I’m ready to fix it.</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> I think that’s a great point. If it’s a small one
and you feel like you’re ~~kind of ~~right on that edge, then I have
a low threshold to just cut down.</p>
<p>And that way, ~~you know, <del>you afford yourself, I think a little
bit</del> , um,~~ more assured sort of placement sure. Placement with an
open, which is also relatively easy or should be, <del>uh , to,</del> to do it
open the other. The other thing, I don’t know if you’ve used, I
sometimes will oil the sheets with mineral oil, <del>you know, I’ll put it
on the.</del></p>
<p><del>On the , uh, I mean, you know,</del> the other question here we haven’t
really talked about is ~~heparin ~~heparin eyes or not. We can get
to that, but sometimes I’ll get some mineral oil on the back, ~~you
know, ~~and I’ll just cover the sheath. If you think [00:27:00] it’s
going to be tight and <del>sort of make that , um,</del> make the sheath as
you’re passing it from the femoral up ~~the, ~~the small externally,
like into the end of the AOR to make it slick, if you will.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> Yeah, you~~ , uh,~~ are reading our minds, sir. So
I was actually going to bring this question to Dr. Kazi. ~~Um, <del>many
of these patients are multi injured as we’ve discussed and have</del> ,
uh,~~ head injuries, maybe even head bleeds. ~~Um, ~~do you
recognize in all of these cases, is there cases where you won’t</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> have her nice? ~~Well, ~~it’s interesting in our
group, we have a variation of practice patterns.</p>
<p>~~Uh, <del>I guess number one is if the neurosurgeon or someone.
Completely contraindicate you to using heparin. And then you’re a little
bit in a bind. I haven’t really found that to be largely the case, but
it does come up every now and then I personally like to Hep denies, even
if it’s just a little bit of heparin</del> , um,~~ 3000 of heparin, just
to~~ , uh,~~ allow me to have the optimal device, but I don’t think
it’s necessary.</p>
<p>One of the things that you and I discussed recently because we repaired
A symptomatic AAA three days ago on a COVID positive patient. Kevin was,
we were concerned about the thrombosis [00:28:00] with the large sheets.
~~Um, <del>Dr. Rassman, what do you think with the COVID patients</del> ,
um,~~ and heparin in general~~ , uh, do you, ~~do you have denies
all of your T VARs and what ha what if you had a COVID positive patient?</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> That’s a great question. <del>I mean, I think , um, You
know , I,</del> I remember~~ , um,~~ my first <del>sort of</del> TVRS for blunt
aortic injury when I was in San Antonio and I was amazed at~~ ,
um,~~ how. ~~Um, <del>if the patient’s condition allows it</del> , uh,~~
and I think most of them do~~ , uh,~~ operative planning. So
imaging~~ , uh,~~ trying to get some resuscitation, maybe even,
~~you know, ~~a 12 to 24 hour delay and the repair.</p>
<p>If you get everything lined up and it’s a straightforward~~ , uh,~~
repair~~ , um,~~ how ~~you, ~~you can really get these stent
grafts in and. ~~Sort of ~~30 minutes or less. ~~Um, I don’t, <del>I
don’t want to exaggerate or tell a fish story here. So I</del> , uh, you
know, <del>I know it’s never as quick as we surgeons think it is, but the
point is if you can get it done quickly and the patient has other</del> ,
uh,~~ contraindications, a head bleed, solid organ injury, ~~you
know, ~~big hematoma and a fractured femur or [00:29:00] something,
then I think they can be done safely without heparin.</p>
<p>~~Um, <del>and I think</del> , um,~~ one just needs to be mindful of the
time. ~~Um, <del>and then really flushing out the femoral and then
assessing the access side or site</del> , uh,~~ when you’re done. ~~Um,
~~so I think they can be done safely without heparin. ~~Um, ~~now
~~the, <del>the flip side is if the patient has no solid organ injury,
TBI hematoma, and the thigh from a femur fracture</del> , then,~~ then
proceeding with the use of heparin is it would be preferred.</p>
<p>~~You know, ~~I think that’s always preferred. ~~Um, ~~so I
think, ~~you know, <del>I guess what I would say is I would prefer to use
heparin. I do in all the cases that I can</del> , uh,~~ but I don’t sweat
it too much if I can’t, because of other conditions, the patient has
other injuries. I just am more attentive to the time my sheets are in.</p>
<p>And then to what’s happened. What’s the status of the Elio femoral
segment. After I’ve removed the sheets. I think in COVID positive
patients, I think they’ve shown [00:30:00] themselves to be relatively
hypercoagulable and I~~ would , uh, I would want to I’d, you know, I
I’d have a more , um, you know , uh, th I~~ think the imperative to
<del>anticoagulate</del> coagulate, those patients would be higher because of
their~~ , uh, shown <del>propensity to develop</del> , uh,~~ thrombus.</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> Yeah, that’s exactly what Kevin and I did with that
endo AAA patient is we pepper to them more than we normally would. And
then followed act pretty closely to make sure they stayed over two 50,</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> a really good point. And we didn’t really mention
it, but the act, the activated clotting time, I think, ~~you know,
~~we talked about operative planning and, ~~you know, ~~for your
listeners, I think.</p>
<p>~~You know, ~~we tell our trainees ~~the best, ~~the best
resident, the best surgeons are pessimists. ~~You know, ~~it sounds
bad. I don’t want to be a downer before the holidays, but you have to
anticipate things going wrong and never be the optimist. ~~Right. Uh,
~~if I have a major injury or condition, I want my doctor to be
worried that everything’s going to go wrong.</p>
<p>~~Uh, ~~I’m exaggerating a little bit to make the point. The part of
that is the act machine. Like how many times have we been in the
employment? And we need an activated clotting time because we really,
whether it’s for carotid or endarterectomy or this type of an [00:31:00]
injury, and ~~you know, ~~the, our staff, our anesthesia colleagues,
not necessarily to a fault of theirs, they’ll say, Oh, ~~we don’t
~~basically team.</p>
<p>Machine’s not working. Or we don’t have it or something. ~~Right.
~~So part of the pre-op planning ~~for, ~~for house officers is,
~~you know, <del>among all the other things is where’s the act machine.
And could we draw a test act before the case starts because Dr. Kazi
really needs the act on this one. And</del> , um, the last time you, you
know, <del>the worst time to hear</del> , well,~~ the act machine is not
available.</p>
<p>It doesn’t work. Cause when you’ve got a, ~~you know, <del>an 18 French
sheath up a small iliac and an undergrad in the order, So I agree with
the act and</del> , uh,~~ I don’t want to sound too much like a pessimist.
Maybe I’m just a realist~~ , um,~~ that, ~~you know, <del>putting
that on the pre-op timeout, for example, if you’re going to do team
steps or time out</del> , uh,~~ make sure that ~~you’re ~~you’re you
got that act lined up.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. ~~Uh, ~~so there’s two <del>kind
of</del> main points we want to cover here~~ , uh,~~ to wrap up , topic.
And one of them is the subclavian artery. And as we discussed before,
the average distance between the injury and [00:32:00] a subclavian is
about 5.8 millimeters. And most of these devices recommend a two
centimeter coverage and healthy vessel.</p>
<p>~~Um, ~~and then two centimeters distal in order to adequate
coverage. <del>so. And , and,</del> and using those numbers, the registry
suggests about 40% of patients have their subclavians covered in these
cases. ~~So, <del>Dr. Rasmussen, what are your thoughts on covering
subclavian artery? Do you</del> , um,~~ do anything to revascularize it
<del>AF</del> if you do~~ , uh,~~ cover it and ~~any, ~~any thoughts
you have on this?</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> Yeah. Great question. this also has evolved~~ ,
uh,~~ and I think can be institution specific. Although I think most
institutions now have gone to not. <del>Uh, um , um,</del> preemptively,
revascularizing the subclavian. So maybe for, if we take a step back~~
, uh,~~ I don’t want to take too much time, but I think for your
listeners, what we’re talking about here <del>is , is,</del> is covering with
that covered stent.</p>
<p>So you’ve got to get that covered stent graft up over. In into the
distal part of the aortic arch to seal to [00:33:00] get a good two
centimeter length of seal before that aortic tear that happened most
commonly at the aortic isthmus. ~~Right. ~~And so sometimes that
requires covering the left subclavian artery. And while that seems
crazy, most patients do just fine with that.</p>
<p>Actually they may have a little bit of arm claudication, but do just
fine. And what that allows us to do is to then get that two centimeters
of seal. ~~Uh, ~~where the stent graph is really well. ~~Well,
~~opposed to the inner curve of the aortic arch, if you will, <del>uh ,
or,</del> or the outer curve. <del>Um , the,</del> the things that I think about, I
think~~ , uh,~~ where’s the vertebral artery.</p>
<p>~~So the, ~~so the risks of covering the left side, Clarion, I
mentioned <del>arm , uh,</del> arm claudication~~ , um,~~ or Ms. Schema, so
real close attention to , <del>uh,</del> and then another complication could be
stroke. ~~Right. <del>So that</del> , um, if , if,~~ if the patient has,
<del>uh , uh,</del> the dominant vertebral artery is on the left and it comes
off the left subclavian, and for some reason they don’t have a right to
vertebral, then you really need to revasc you’ve got to, you can’t cover
the left subclavian without [00:34:00] revascularizing.</p>
<p><del>Um, you know , um,</del> that subclavian and the verge~~ , um,~~ so
paying attention to <del>where the w</del> what ~~the, <del>the dominant vert
is, where it’s from, what is the right vertebral artery look like? Is
there atherosclerotic disease in the arch and the great vessels to
include the birds? And then the third main complication is spinal cord
ischemia</del> , um,~~ and weirdly~~ , uh, you know, <del>for your
listeners, you think</del> , well,~~ how can covering the left subclavian
lead to spinal cord ischemia?</p>
<p>~~Um, ~~and if you. Think back to how our spinal cord is perfused.
~~Um, <del>it is rare in a very it’s uncommon</del> , but,~~ but there are
collateral pathways ~~through the, ~~through the Ima, the internal
mammaries and <del>to,</del> through other, <del>um , uh,</del> collateral
circulations that originate off the subclavian. Whereas subclavian
profusion can be important to perfuse the spine.</p>
<p>~~So, you know, <del>Making sure that you have those three things in
mind, left arm, claudication, posterior circulation, stroke, spinal cord
ischemia. And as long as you have those front and center</del> , um, you
know, ~~most of the time you can still cover that left subclavian
[00:35:00] without. Revascularizing it. And you will be cognizant of the
situations where you do need to revascularize it either before you do
the T bar or at the same time.</p>
<p>~~Um, ~~or sometimes afterwards.</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> Yeah, this is always an interesting situation,
particularly some more rare scenarios that often comes up as well as~~
, uh,~~ as you said, the right for T-ball already may be occluded.
There’s a dialysis access and the left arm or the one that concerns me
the most is if there’s a Lima to an LA ~~ , uh, I don’t, I agree.~~
I agree.</p>
<p>I don’t think there’s an easy answer on these. ~~Uh, <del>we have</del> ,
uh,~~ laser finished rated a few endograft for these rare cases with
pretty good result. And I do think that there’s some graphs on the
horizon. That’s going to allow us to preserve that left subclavian
artery~~ , um,~~ in the</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> future. Really good point about the Lima. So for the
listeners, that means that the patient’s had a cabbage and they’ve got
their ~~eyes ~~left. Ima going into the, <del>for example, anterior ,
uh, or to the, into a</del> coronary. So you can’t, <del>you know, you can’t</del>
cover that ~~without <del>you might cause a M I, [00:36:00] And I think
good point on the future of the graphs, I think we do have already
branch graphs that</del> , uh,~~ may not yet be approved for trauma, but
they’re probably coming, which will help.</p>
<p>And did we talk about, or maybe I’ll ask a question. I don’t know if
that’s fair. <del>Uh , uh,</del> Kevin and Wayne, but did we talk about spinal
cord drainage? I mentioned, ~~you know, ~~spinal cord ischemia and a
rare incidence in paraplegia, ~~you know, <del>do you guys</del> , uh,~~ in
San Antonio preemptively~~ , uh,~~ do spinal cord drainage~~ ,
uh,~~ for blunt aortic injuries that you’re going to put an undergrad
in or not?</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> ~~Uh, ~~no. ~~Um, <del>in general, it’s thought
that</del> , uh,~~ likely due to the short distance of coverage with these
graphs, that there’s not a lot of~~ , uh,~~ intercostals that are
~~kind of ~~covered and putting the spinal cord at risk. I think
~~the, ~~the risk of spinal cord ischemia is extremely low in these
cases, but it’s something you certainly.</p>
<p>Have to have in mind and have your anesthesia team or neurosurgery
colleagues~~ , um,~~ aware of and available for~~ , uh,~~ should
the situation change. And so certainly a motor in [00:37:00] neuro exam
at the conclusion of the case is critical. And I think we would
respond~~ , uh,~~ with~~ , uh,~~ elevating the blood pressures
and~~ , um, you know, <del>potentially placing a spinal drain if there
was concern for</del> , uh,~~ spinal cord ischemia~~ , uh,~~ following
the case, but~~ , uh,~~ routinely~~ , uh,~~ we do not.</p>
<p><del>um , And,</del> and that’s ~~sort of ~~our kind of algorithm for that.
How about you, Dr. Mucin?</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> Yeah, I agree. I don’t have a whole lot more to add.
We do it selectively very uncommonly and that’s also because of the
risks associated with~~ , uh,~~ placing a spinal cord drain. ~~You
know, ~~those aren’t minimal both placing the drain and then
monitoring it effectively.</p>
<p>~~Um, ~~I think we’ve got away from that. I think it is important
for your listeners to understand also that. And I think you referred to
this, that the risk of spinal cord ischemia, when you cover, ~~you
know, ~~a segment ~~of the, of the, ~~of the descending thoracic
aorta, the risk is low because we’re not paving the entire or such a
long segment.</p>
<p>But the risk is~~ , uh, you know, ~~it’s out there for what, 24
hours, 48 hours. So there’s a rare, ~~you know, <del>again, thinking
about being a [00:38:00] pessimist</del> , uh,~~ I guess I should get away
from that term. That sounds bad around the holidays. I’m not trying to
be~~ , uh, but you know, ~~the resident’s house officers, you have
to realize that, that the patients who, for example, come out of the, or
with a normal neuro exam, there is an incidence it’s low to 3%.</p>
<p>But patients who can develop spinal cord ischemia like 24 or 48 hours or
even 72 hours later. So we really have to be mindful ~~of, ~~of the
spinal cord ischemia complication, even though it’s uncommon.</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> Yeah, I think the post-operative care can’t be
understated. The fact that you avoid hypotension, you make sure that the
patient’s properly resuscitated.</p>
<p>And if there is any concern for a neurologic~~ , uh,~~ event that’s
occurring, that you have a system in place to where a lumbar drain can
be placed relatively expeditiously. A couple of things that come to
mind. When I think about spinal drains, particularly for elective cases
are someone who’s had a priority repair~~ , uh,~~ Chronic [00:39:00]
kidney disease to a significant degree, stage four or five, or even in
stage renal disease.</p>
<p><del>And , um,</del> and whether I’m going to need to cover a large segment.
And luckily for most aortic injuries, you’re talking 10 centimeters for
a covered endograft. And so again, that’s going to be ~~the, ~~the
shortest device that’s available. And so it’s going to give you the
lowest risk. As far as an aortic coverage standpoint occurs.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> those are great points and things to keep in mind
when~~ , uh,~~ fixing these patients. ~~Uh, ~~so as we wrap up a
blunt, thoracic aortic injury, we’re going to cover one of the more
important points. There’s a lot of important points here. ~~Uh, <del>but
this one</del> , uh,~~ is the timing of the repair. ~~Um, You know,
~~generally it was thought initially that, ~~you know, ~~you
should repair these sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>~~Um, ~~but Dr. Rasmussen, <del>uh , what,</del> what are your thoughts on
the timing? ~~And, ~~and specifically, I think we’re referring to
the, ~~kind of the, ~~the SVS grade three, the pseudo aneurysms,
<del>uh , what,</del> what are your thoughts on the timing of repair of these.</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> ~~Um, ~~so another great topic, great question
<del>in this, uh , uh,</del> pertaining to this injury pattern.</p>
<p><del>I think that , um, you know, I think that</del> I’ll start with the
premise that [00:40:00] delayed repair ~~is, ~~is certainly
feasible. ~~Um, ~~in many cases <del>and in. Many cases</del> it’s
preferable. And <del>so , um,</del> that’s ~~sort of ~~the premise <del>of ,
of,</del> of the answer and delayed repair, meaning 24 to 48 hours later is
feasible and preferable in many cases.</p>
<p>~~Um, <del>I want to be careful because there’s certainly some cases</del> ,
uh,~~ where it’s, <del>you know , uh,</del> a grade four or a grade three
~~that’s, <del>that’s evolving into a four</del> , uh,~~ where <del>the
patient, you know, the</del> delayed repair is not. Feasible, ~~ , um,~~
but I think that <del>Delaine w</del> what we’ve understood, I think with our
experience broadly on this~~ , um,~~ in the U S is that once you get
a patient under your.</p>
<p>Care in, into your ICU. If they have a grade three repair and they’ve
survived that far and you now can get them on anti impulse therapy, <del>um
, and,</del> and appropriate resuscitation <del>um , that,</del> that waiting 24
hours again is safe ~~and, ~~and preferable. ~~Uh, ~~and I think
the majority of cases, <del>um , and,</del> and why is that?</p>
<p>~~Well, ~~I think it’s because it allows us to do good. [00:41:00]
Operative planning. ~~We’ve, ~~we’ve mentioned ~~sort of <del>the
team steps, if you will, the things that we want to troubleshoot and
anticipate for the repair</del> , uh,~~ whether it’s size of vessel access
assembling the right endograft the right team to include spinal cord
drainage or what, ~~you know, ~~the whole thing.</p>
<p>I think we do a better job. We’re giving ourselves 24 to 36 hours, for
example. And I think it also allows patients other injuries to be
stabilized. So whether that’s a serious TBI~~ , um, you know, ~~long
bone fracture, solid organ injury, <del>uh , uh,</del> I think it, it helps us.
<del>So , um,</del> so I think Delaine <del>is, is , is,</del> is feasible.</p>
<p>We’ve just published. I, we mentioned. ~~Well <del>mentioned a whole lot
of papers here, but</del> , uh,~~ there is a paper in the journal of
vascular surgery~~ , uh,~~ that is a large assessments and just came
out in the journal of vascular surgery, Ramon. ~~Uh, ~~ is the
senior author, Dr. most of ~~you know, ~~is that you, the university
of Texas health science center, and it’s a great paper for a lot of
reasons.</p>
<p>~~It’s, ~~it’s the timing of repair for blunt aortic injuries. So
~~it’s ~~this [00:42:00] paper addresses exactly your question.
~~Um, ~~it’s a great paper cause it’s got a trauma and vascular
surgeons on it. ~~Uh, ~~Bryan Eastridge, Don Jenkins are on it.
~~Uh, <del>but it’s got some really</del> , uh,~~ awesome~~ , uh,~~
vascular surgery fellows from Cleveland clinic who did this when they
were in Cleveland.</p>
<p>~~Uh, ~~and what that analysis of the national trauma DataBank shows
~~is, ~~is just that is that it’s actually a survival benefit
associated with delayed repair. ~~Um, ~~and I won’t go into the
paper. Your readers can look at JBS ~~and, ~~and Ramon, Dr. , <del>uh ,
uh,</del> is you can ~~sort of ~~pub met him, or we can send that paper
out <del>on your, on your , uh,</del> to your listeners~~ , but,~~ but it
does show that there’s a survival benefit for those who have a greater
than 24 hour.</p>
<p>~~Uh, ~~delay in their TVR. And that’s, there’s an analysis that we
did in that paper that, that controls for severity of injury, ~~you
know, <del>meaning that it’s not just because those with less severe
injuries</del> , um,~~ survive longer. ~~Uh <del>there’s undoubtedly some
survivor ship. Bias and that</del> , uh,~~ definitely acknowledged that,
but it, but that paper <del>speaks to</del> its at large NTDB [00:43:00]
analysis of this injury and it speaks to the, value <del>of , of,</del> of
trying to delay repair if possible.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> Yeah, I think it’s a really important~~ , uh,~~
topic~~ , um,~~ to have published the data on, because I think many
surgeons and ER docs~~ , and,~~ and when they hear of a aortic
transection or pseudo aneurysm <del>feel , um, and</del> they may pressure~~
, uh,~~ vascular surgeons to, ~~you know, <del>get in there and fix it.
And I think</del> , uh,~~ knowing this information is critical and
supportive of our community.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> ~~And the, ~~and the delay also allows you to.
Really get an idea of what’s the constellation of the Andrew patterns
that are occurring. <del>I mean , if,</del> if there’s some infectious process
that’s concomitantly going on with the injured patient’s care that can
an infected endograft and the thoracic order can be a nearly.</p>
<p>If not insurmountable problem to try to tackle and~~ , uh,~~ repair.
~~Um, ~~we, I can remember one case where the endograft was infected
and before we could even wrap our hands around it, the aorta had
ruptured and the patient ended up succumbing to their injuries.
But[00:44:00] ~~ , uh, th th ~~delaying it by a little bit of time
affords you the opportunity to really gather as much information as you
can, to make the best decision on when and how to prepare the aorta.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> Yeah. And some of the delays, I mentioned 24 hours,
but I think Wayne is you’re pointing out. It can also be seven days,
~~right. ~~It can be, ~~you know, ~~as long as no, the thing is
that, ~~you know, ~~you can’t ignore the patient, you got to still
stick with anti impulse therapy. ~~Um it’s uh, ~~and ~~you know,
~~very meticulous care cause you can.</p>
<p>~~You know, ~~there are cases certainly where a delay, ~~you know,
~~can fail, ~~you know, ~~and those are cases where we lose track
of their blood pressure ~~and, <del>and</del> , uh, you know, <del>something
happens in the, or for a femur fracture or something, and we lose track
and</del> , uh,~~ we’re not communicating as a multidisciplinary team and
you can turn a stable.</p>
<p>~~Uh, you know, <del>grade three injury that you’re observing for four,
three or four or five days into one that ruptures that’s were very rare.
But again</del> , uh,~~ we want to be mindful ~~of, <del>of</del> , uh,~~
just because we’re delaying doesn’t mean you get a free pass until the,
or, and~~ , uh,~~ five [00:45:00] days</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> later. ~~Right? ~~I think if I may, personally, if
I’m going to be watching.</p>
<p>~~Uh, <del>grade three aortic injury</del> , um,~~ up to seven days that
patient’s going to stay in the ICU with very close monitoring that
entire time until the time of the repair.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> These are fantastic points. And I think we really
covered blunt, thoracic aortic injury~~ , uh,~~ quite in depth. And
I think our listeners will really enjoy this.</p>
<p>We have two more topics that are much briefer to cover here as we close
out the endovascular management of trauma. ~~Um, ~~so we’re gonna
move down the order a little bit. We’re going to do below the diaphragm,
and this is pretty rare, but <del>there are.</del> Important to keep this in
mind. ~~Um, ~~the blunt abdominal aortic injuries in the
endovascular approach to this.</p>
<p>~~Um, <del>so many times it’s a similar sort of patient population as
the</del> , uh,~~ thoracic aortic injuries~~ , uh,~~ where it’s a
multiple injured trauma. And when we described the blunt abdominal work
injury, they in, in repairing it for endovascular, there’s three zones
that are thought of~~ , um,~~ and the numbers ones, and three are
the ones that you can repair~~ , um,~~ endovascular.</p>
<p>So the zone one is from the diaphragm down to the SMA. ~~Um, <del>zone
[00:46:00] two is the SMA and renal arteries are relatively small
segment, but</del> , uh,~~ that’s the zone two. And then zone three is
from <del>the inferior renal</del> inferior to the renal arteries, to the
aortic bifurcation. ~~Um, so. ~~Zone one and zone three, <del>you know,
above , uh,</del> from above the SMA two.</p>
<p>And then also below the renal arteries are the two areas that are
amenable to endovascular repair.</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> Yeah. Fortunately, Kevin, these things are
extraordinarily uncommon. ~~I mean, ~~most vascular surgeons at
level one trauma centers, I would wager can count on one or two hands,
depending on how old they are. The number of these injuries they’ve had
to manage from an endovascular standpoint.</p>
<p>I think Dr. Rasmussen, what do you think about coverage of the celiac
artery? ~~Um, ~~and what are the factors you think about if you had
to prepare something in that area?</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> Yeah, I think that~~ , um,~~ I think there’s
increasing~~ , um,~~ literature, including I think~~ , uh,~~ an
article and I’m just, won’t pull the journal here, but I think it’s.</p>
<p>Yeah, it’s this November~~ , uh,~~ JVs about the feasibility and
safety of covering the celiac artery it’s [00:47:00] what’s in this
month. JBS is not pertaining to trauma, but it’s talking about~~ ,
uh,~~ covering the celiac for~~ , uh,~~ for T VAR EMR, for
example, for aneurysm disease. I think we’re learning that you can cover
the celiac safely.</p>
<p>In many cases, I think it, it reminds me of what the left subclavian was
10 years ago. ~~No, ~~no, we were a little nervous. We knew there
were some patients you couldn’t cover it in. And now 10 years later, we
pretty routinely covered that left subclavian. ~~Uh, ~~and I think
the celiac artery is similar. It reminds me of that.</p>
<p>I think in patients, obviously you’ve got to look at the make sure
they’ve got and SMA~~ , uh,~~ probably an Ima and then internal
iliac arteries, ~~you know, ~~looking at the blood supply to the
whole of their mesentery. And if any of that’s compromised, then that
would give me. ~~Um, you know, ~~pause, certainly if they’ve had a,
~~you know, ~~a gastrectomy here or some unusual intra-abdominal
operation, that’s interrupted their bowel.</p>
<p>If you will, the gut circulation that would give me pause to cover the
celiac. ~~Um, you know, <del>but otherwise I think if it really gets you
out of a [00:48:00] jam</del> , uh,~~ which these injuries are like, so
yeah, you’re right. Wayne, they’re pretty rare, but man~~ ,
they’re,~~ they’re really hard to. Try to repair open. So that gets a
person out of a jam and you need to cover the celiac.</p>
<p>I think he can.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> Yeah. I think those are fantastic points. And, ~~you
know, <del>just like with the</del> , uh,~~ thoracic injuries and other,
~~you know, <del>situation where you have to be prepared to respond</del> ,
um,~~ with a bypass, potentially ~~if, <del>if</del> , um, you know,
~~you have a schema that you didn’t expect. ~~Um, ~~and so it’s
just things to keep in mind.</p>
<p>And one thing I think the we like talked about here is the IVIS is also
very helpful. It’s ~~kind of ~~like a, with. Dissection cases. A lot
of these cases are <del>sort of , um,</del> kind of variants of dissections
~~of, <del>of the traumatic. And so the IVIS can really help characterize
this. You can help identify these large intimal flaps</del> , um,~~ in
pseudo aneurysms ~~or , uh, kind of, ~~and see the branches and help
plan your stint graft placement all with IVIS.</p>
<p>~~So, ~~So, one thing to keep in mind when, especially if these
patients might not tolerate a lot of contrasts and other kind of
situation to keep in mind, this is an, a patient with significant
<del>Tesla.</del> Intestinal contamination ~~ , uh,~~ the endovascular
approach to this [00:49:00] would help~~ , uh, eliminate any or. You
know, ~~minimize any risk of contamination.</p>
<p>~~Uh, <del>so Dr. Kazi, as far as the types of graphs</del> , um,~~ that
you’re thinking of when you have a patient~~ , uh,~~ what are you
using? Are you using Tavarez covered since Eric cuffs? What’s your
preferred method?</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> My preferred method is to use whatever. Means is going
to cover the least amount of aorta, but still seal the injury.</p>
<p>~~Um, ~~so the answer to that is, yes, ~~I ~~I’d use all of
them. ~~Um, ~~some of the newer covered balloon expandable and post
dilatable stints have changed our management, particularly in the
smaller aorta is at our level one trauma center. We carry. Basically the
entire catalog of balloon expandable coverage stents.</p>
<p>~~Uh, <del>one that Kevin recently showed me</del> , um,~~ was we did an
iliac branch case last week and the~~ , uh,~~ covered stent. I
didn’t realize started up. It started eight millimeters and goes all the
way up to ~~11. I’m sorry. <del>16 millimeters. Previously, it was a 11
millimeter stent that could be post dilated up to 16. So in the smaller
aorta is</del> , uh,~~ I think these have a role~~ , um,~~ and being
able to post dilate them.</p>
<p>The [00:50:00] question is how to keep it in place when you’re post
dilating it so that it doesn’t move. And so if that’s a concern, then
oftentimes I will go to a, <del>uh , uh,</del> thoracic graft or an aortic cuff
or~~ , uh,~~ something that I know is going to deploy and stay
stable the entire time.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> And I think~~ , uh,~~ now we’re going to move into
our final topic of the day is XLO sub cleaving injuries and endovascular
management.</p>
<p>We chose these three topics is endovascular care has really ~~kind of
<del>in some ways revolutionized</del> , uh,~~ the management of these. <del>And
so , um,</del> as we know the injuries to the XL, subclavian is very rare.
And it’s likely due to the protective nature of the skeleton, but the
fact of the skeleton there also makes it very difficult to obtain
proximal and distal control.</p>
<p><del>So , uh,</del> Dr. Kazi, if you have a patient with some kind of contained
some Flavian injury~~ , um,~~ and you’re going to approach this from
an endovascular approach~~ , uh, H w~~ what approach do you prefer
to, to access this.</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> My preferred approach is from the arm, if at
[00:51:00] all possible~~ , um,~~ that could either be brachial or
radio.</p>
<p>~~Um, ~~depending on the, again, if you have a covered stent that
can be post dilated to a size that can be delivered through a seven
French sheath, and you can use ~~a, <del>a radial access for those
patients in that</del> , uh,~~ Can be done percutaneously with low risk.
Otherwise I do like to cut down on the brachial artery, if I’m~~ ,
um,~~ going to the brachial artery for trauma just seems to be more
reliable for me and sometimes even quicker.</p>
<p><del>But, uh , I,</del> I like the brachial approach, but sometimes I’ll do
both the brachial and the femoral approach~~ , uh,~~ and combine
that with a through wire. If I have a really tough or challenging aortic
arch and I need to deliver something. Say to the proximal, ~~right.
~~Subclavian. ~~Um, <del>and you’ve got</del> , uh,~~ a type three arch
or something to that effect.</p>
<p>And I liked the through wire.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> Great. And so as far as ~~you know, like
~~discussing our stint options here, and ~~I <del>I’ve heard</del> ,
uh,~~ debates even on Twitter about this, about whether to use a
self-expanding scent, because it might give you more flexibility,
especially if it’s in the axillary artery~~ , um,~~ versus balloon
expandable~~ , um,~~ more precise [00:52:00] deployment, especially
if near <del>kind of</del> branch vessels.</p>
<p>~~Um, ~~Dr. SBS. And do you have a, do you have a preferred stint or
do you just base it on the situation?</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> I think that we~~ , um,~~ had~~ , uh, you
know, ~~I think initially we aired. ~~Um, ~~and ~~well, <del>I
don’t know, we erred on the side of self-expanding initially, if you
think back</del> , um, you know, ~~when we first started treating this
injury pattern with endo techniques covered stents, all of the covered
stents available were self-expanding.</p>
<p>~~We didn’t really have , um, you know, <del>10, 15 years ago, we didn’t
have viable</del> , um,~~ Balloon expandable covered stents. And so I
think, ~~you know, <del>therefore that’s what we got used to, whether it
was the via Bon or the old fluency or whatever the self-expanding. And
so we got used to that and I think more recently in the last three to
four, five years</del> , uh,~~ there’s now~~ , um,~~ really nice
balloon expandable covered stents, which are flexible, I think it’s
dealer’s choice in a lot of ways. I do think there is truth to~~ ,
um,~~ balloon expandable for more precise landing. ~~You know, <del>I
just think that [00:53:00] premise of stenting is holds true, meaning
that if you gotta really nail something</del> , uh, you know, <del>close to a
Lima an internal mammary</del> , um, for you~~ read in relation to the
vertebral.</p>
<p>~~Um, you know, <del>blue expandable is I think more accurate if it’s</del> ,
uh,~~ more distally and needed in a longer stand in the axilla than
using a self-expanding is just fine. Another thing that, ~~you know,
~~I think you may get to, but sometimes there’s you need to come from
both right.</p>
<p>The arm, retro grade. ~~Um, ~~but if he can’t retrograde, ~~you
know, <del>sometimes coming antegrade</del> , um,~~ for imaging and sometimes
<del>to , to,</del> to really make that connection between the disruption but
coming from the groin into the. Origin of the subclavian axillary~~ ,
uh,~~ antegrade ~~is, ~~is needed as well.</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> one of my techniques for that was to have a through
wire. So I had snare wire and the descending thoracic aorta. especially
for challenging arch. Then I would come across with a sheath from the
femoral artery and then deploy my stint with a through wire. ~~Um,
<del>and that I felt, gives me a pretty [00:54:00] precise deployment</del> ,
uh,~~ particularly if I’m really trying to nail something.</p>
<p>And I want to make sure that there’s no curves or bends and that the
stent delivery. Which is usually a little stiffer than the sheath is
going to be able to make it around and be very precise. Particularly if
you’re trying, like you said, nail on a vertebral artery or~~ ,
um,~~ and Ima</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> yeah, we had one where we, our last one we did here,
a couple of my partners are pretty crafty and skilled ~~and, ~~and
~~we, <del>we actually had to put us</del> , uh,~~ we had to, I think we
used a snare, <del>right.</del></p>
<p>from the arm. We couldn’t get ~~ , uh,~~ the wire to make the
approach. So we put a aim up, ~~you know, ~~antegrade through the
lifts of Clayton, got a snare ~~sort of ~~out there, and we’re able
to snare the free wire and bring it through. That’s pretty rare, pretty
uncommon. <del>Um, but you know , uh,</del> I think those are all techniques
that we’re learning~~ , uh,~~ for the, kind of the fringes of these
injury patterns, which used to be too severe for us to treat with endo.</p>
<p>And now we’re actually finding with technology and experience that
actually ~~you can, ~~you can treat the vast majority of these.
[00:55:00]</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> Yeah. These are~~ , uh, A lot, ~~a lot of options
and things are going to continue to evolve as our technology improves.
It’s ~~kind of ~~a theme of this episode. ~~Uh, ~~</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> I seem to find that when people have these injuries
there, for some reason that maybe this is just my own experience, it
seems to be that they’re more contra-indicated for anticoagulation.</p>
<p>I don’t know if it’s because the~~ , uh,~~ nature of the injury to
injure something in the, ~~you know, ~~in the. Bony thorax, such as
scapulothoracic dissociation or a sub claiming artist, pseudo aneurysm.
I remember I can remember there’s cases where the central line goes in
for a head injured patient because they need to monitor their CVPs.</p>
<p>~~Um, ~~I prefer to have a brachial open approach to that. And when
I can’t give anticoagulation, just because I can, then I’m set up to do
an embolectomy if need be for the brachial artery.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> Yeah, ~~I think that, ~~I think that’s a great
point. And just wrap this up, and as far as discussing, ~~you know,
~~options you have from the endovascular approach, there really it’s
up to your imagination.</p>
<p>~~ , uh, you know , uh,~~ whether it’s [00:56:00] approximate rights
of Cleveland injury, approximal, left, subclavian and injury. ~~Um,
you know, ~~you can use a hybrid approach. ~~I <del>I’ve seen multiple
examples of</del> , uh,~~ large hematomas where~~ , uh,~~ proximal,
distal control are obtained~~ , uh,~~ whether it’s over a three wire
from the arm.</p>
<p>~~Um, ~~and then you can approach it open. ~~Um, ~~it really
helps in that situation. ~~Um, <del>I know</del> , uh,~~ recently we had a
case where we did some parallel stinting of the brachiocephalic in order
~~to, ~~to treat injury. <del>Um , and,</del> and you can even use~~ ,
uh,~~ the approach to embolize. You can embolize the subclavian
arteries~~ , um,~~ and ~~you know, <del>and do things</del> , uh,~~
with.</p>
<p>As long as you’re respecting the people already. <del>So , uh,</del> keep in
mind, ~~you know, <del>there’s not one kind of recipe for treating these
exits of Cleveland injuries</del> , um,~~ and really ~~kind of
~~adjusting it to the patient. ~~you know, kind of <del>the last thing
I’ll mention is</del> , uh,~~ sometimes these patients, ~~you know,
~~would probably do better with a bypass, especially with some
axillary artery injuries.</p>
<p>~~You know, <del>it’s going to be in a pretty mobile spot</del> , uh,~~ but
they’re too sick. And <del>so , uh,</del> I’ve seen it even done where they use
a stint graph to temporize things, to keep inline flow. And then at a
more stable time, maybe a week, a month later, take them back and
perform the bypass</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> [00:57:00] before you end. I don’t want to get
you~~ , uh,~~ let you off the hook.</p>
<p>I think the question for you guys and your listeners <del>and , and,</del> and
this may be the most important question of our discussion is to what
degree does it, should we in the military? Try to take these endo
technologies into our deployed hospitals. ~~Um, ~~we’ve just
discussed a range of injuries in which patients do better.</p>
<p>~~Right? <del>So they bleed less. They’re often less</del> , uh,~~ less
frequently paralyzed from T-bar for example~~ , uh,~~ they survive
more, they~~ , uh,~~ with these endo technologies. So are we telling
ourselves ~~that ~~that’s okay for civilians off the street in the U
S. ~~Uh, ~~but not good enough. <del>Uh , but,</del> but our, what our
service members have to just ~~kind of ~~get by and the deployed
range.</p>
<p>Do you know when they’re down range with these injuries or is it our
responsibility to develop systems of casualty care in which we can take
these technologies down range? What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>Wayne Causey:</strong> Yeah, I think that’s a great point. <del>I mean , um,</del>
Obviously the farther [00:58:00] out you get. So like when I was in a
Ford surgical team in Afghanistan, we, it took us three months to
get~~ , um,~~ the most primitive x-ray machine you could think of.</p>
<p>And just to get a chest x-ray to see if there was a pneumothorax. But
when you get back to the rural three~~ , um,~~ level, which for
everyone, for the listeners, that’s a combat support hospital. So there
were, for instance, there would be one in Baghdad. So there’s one that
triages to the next level of care from all the forward surgical teams to
a combat support hospital.</p>
<p>~~There’s, <del>there’s two in Afghanistan, for instance, but</del> , um,~~
They ~~don’t ~~are always equipped with endovascular technologies as
Dr. Rasmussen’s really alluding to. And as a matter of fact, there,
there are going to be no thoracic endo to repair there’s. ~~Um,
~~the capabilities is digital subtraction angiography. ~~Um,
~~usually it best to say, ~~you know, ~~treat a bypass.</p>
<p>Yeah. But I do think that one of the things we brought up in this
podcast and Dr. Brass means I’d be interested in ~~your, ~~your
thoughts is that we have demonstrated that there is a delayed [00:59:00]
timing of repair for a Arctic injuries. And I do think that deployment
and placing an, a thoracic endograft or a covered stent.</p>
<p>In say Germany, Walter Reed or San Antonio is much better than trying to
do the same thing in Baghdad or bog room or Kandahar Afghanistan,
because~~ , um, there are~~ the, a septic techniques are not going
to be the same there as they are here. And the bacteria and the
microorganisms that exist in those environments are also significantly
different than what we experienced in the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Todd Rasmussen:</strong> Yeah, I think it’s a great question. And, ~~you
know, ~~I kinda, I get a little bit fired up about it. ~~Um, ~~I
know you’ve got a lot of young, <del>you know , you’ve,</del> you’ve guys got
the future~~ , uh,~~ who are your listeners? ~~You know, ~~and I
think ~~there <del>there’s a ton of</del> , um,~~ brain power, ~~you
know, <del>intellectual capacity that listens to this</del> , uh,~~ and it’s
to your guys’s credit.</p>
<p>I think ~~it’s, ~~it’s going to be up ~~to, ~~to the next
generation, ~~right. <del>To figure out. How do we integrate</del> , uh,~~
endo [01:00:00] technologies for wartime scenarios and~~ , um, you
know, ~~and I think <del>to it’s , it’s,</del> it’s like it’s too big of a
topic to answer that with one question. But I think if you take it
in~~ , in, in, in~~ sort of intervals and you say~~ , well,~~ in
the near term, right?</p>
<p>So from now to 2022, 2023, Maybe all we can do is get like what you
said, Wayne. Let’s make sure we have vascular go teams on the West coast
and the East coast. ~~Uh, <del>who can go into the Pacific or the
European theater, African theater</del> , uh,~~ with endo stuff.
~~Right? ~~So that ~~if, <del>if we can’t get a casually back, we
can</del> , um, you know, ~~figure out what we can do in the near term.</p>
<p>But, ~~you know, in the, in the, ~~in the midterm, whose fault is it
that there’s no digital subtraction NGO to rule three? Is that, do we
just going to blame it on the system and say, it’s a damn shame. Where
is that our fault? ~~Right. ~~Cause we’re not articulating this. And
I think, <del>you know , we,</del> we should think about that.</p>
<p>I think that, yes. ~~Uh, ~~so you know, most of the time a covered
stent for sure. Yeah, absolutely. Wayne. ~~I mean, ~~you’d
definitely rather have a T-bar and, ~~you know, <del>Germany or</del> ,
uh,~~ [01:01:00] Walter Reed or bamse ~~than, ~~than in Ballade or
Bodrum, Afghanistan, for example. But some patients can’t wait.
~~Right. ~~And ~~so. You know, ~~how do we establish an endo
specific trauma inventory and get it into the cash?</p>
<p>~~Right? <del>So the, for the select cases who can’t wait, what if it’s a
type three or type four</del> , uh,~~ blunt, aortic injury, do we then
commit that service member to, ~~you know, ~~an antiquated
treatment, maybe ~~ , uh, if it’s a one cause,~~ and it’s
particularly relevant in this discussion, because you’ve mentioned
injury patterns that can be highly lethal, but are particularly
amenable.</p>
<p>To end of therapies, ~~you know, ~~and there’s no answer to it. And
I don’t mean to get too fired up, but ~~I, ~~I’m excited to ~~sort
of ~~pose that question to the young and innovative, ~~you know,
~~listeners that you guys have to help us think about. What does a
trauma specific endo inventory, how can it be brought to, ~~you know,
~~resource limited circumstances or scenarios to, to provide the
benefit that these technologies have to some of these patients.</p>
<p>It’s great discussion. And [01:02:00] I really appreciate the
opportunity to spend some time with, <del>uh , uh,</del> with you guys. <del>Uh ,
and,</del> and~~ , uh,~~ it’s been fun.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Kniery:</strong> Absolutely. And doctor asked me to sing. You have to
thank you for this entire series for joining us and taking time out of
your very busy schedule to get down and dirty and talk very specific and
very technical.</p>
<p>~~Um, ~~I think this will be a resource for years to come for both
the listeners of behind the knife and audible bleeding. So thank you.
Thank you again, and thank you, Dr. Kazi for joining us and helping us
with this discussion. Yeah. Thanks</p>
